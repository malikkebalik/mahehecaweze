Later, Facebook cleared the air that her page was automatically blocked as other users had flagged her content as being offensive.</li><li>In December 2017, 4 years after her controversial post went viral, she re-enacted the same pose with her then older kids and captioned it “What’s Your Reason”.</li><li>She also manages two residential care facilities for the elderly, situated in Elk Grove and Sacramento.</li><li>She has a pet dog named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Ranger</a> which is of the Goldendoodle (a hybrid of golden retriever and a poodle) breed.</li><li>Visit her official website @ mariakang.com.</li><li>Follow her on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>YouTube</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Google+</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by Maria Kang / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq6GRYriiusZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
