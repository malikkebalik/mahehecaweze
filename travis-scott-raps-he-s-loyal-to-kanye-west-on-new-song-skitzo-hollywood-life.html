The track was “recorded on December 8, 2020, during Utopia sessions in Mexico,” per Genius. “Kanye recorded his vocals in June of 2021 for a version that also features <strong>James Blake</strong> and <strong>Justin Vernon</strong> of Bon Iver. Travis confirmed the song’s release for Utopia on July 22, 2023, at his Rolling Loud set where it was displayed along with 4 other titles in the fictional Utopian language from Thomas More’s 1516 book Utopia.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>However, when the track was actually released, Kanye’s vocals weren’t included. Instead, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Beyonce</strong></a> was featured on the track. Kanye has writer and/or producer credits on “Delresto,” “Thank God,” “God’s Country,” and “Telekinesis.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>This album is not the first time Ye and La Flame have worked together. Travis appeared on Ye’s “Champions” in 2016, “Wash Us In The Blood” in 2020, and “Praise God” in 2021. Ye joined Travis on 2015’s “Piss On Your Grave,” on 2016’s “In Common (remix),” and on &nbsp;2018’s “Watch.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kanye-west-and-travis-scott-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Ye came under fire in October 2022 after tweeting he was going “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.” A week later, when he spoke with <strong>Piers Morgan</strong>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ye refused to apologize</a>. In the weeks following, Adidas <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cut ties with Ye</a> and Yeezy Sneakers. He faced <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>condemnation</a> across the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>board</a>, and his Twitter account was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>suspended for inciting violence</a>. Since then, Ye has kept a low profile, save for the time he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bianca Censori</strong></a> in secret (and when he was under investigation for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>grabbing a woman’s phone</a>.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Ahead of Utopia‘s release, Travis teamed up with another KarJenner-adjacent individual. Travis, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bad Bunny</a></strong>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Weeknd</a></strong> teamed for “K-Pop.” Bad Bunny has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>linked to Kylie’s sister</a>, <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>, since February 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FxZq2qkau2tHnSnKatrF2grq%2FFxGaunqukYrumw4yspqefXai4qsDZqGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
