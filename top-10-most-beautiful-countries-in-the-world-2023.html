Italy</h3><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65012 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Top-10-Most-Beautiful-Countries-In-The-World-Italy.jpg alt width=1000 height=665 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-65012 class=wp-caption-text>Most Beautiful Countries In The World</p><p>Italy is a country in south-central Europe that sits atop a peninsula jutting far into the Mediterranean Sea. Italy is frequently referred to be a boot-shaped country since it has some of the most diverse and beautiful landscapes on the planet. The Alps, one of the most untamed mountain ranges in the world, are situated at its broad top.</p><p>Rome, the country’s capital, is one of the oldest and most famous cities in the world. Tourists love to visit Rome to see its magnificent buildings and works of art as well as to partake in the city’s renowned “dolce vita,” or “sweet life.”</p><p>It’s difficult to know where to begin when talking about Italy and its beauty. It’s praised for its delectable cuisine, charming pastel villages, and long-standing love for the arts. Rome is the birthplace of Western civilization and offers a wealth of historic monuments for urban dwellers and history aficionados to explore.</p><p>Vernazza, one of the Cinque Terre villages, invites lovers to meander through the brightly coloured alleys before sitting on the harbour.

Switzerland</h3><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65013 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Top-10-Most-Beautiful-Countries-In-The-World-Switzerland.jpg alt="Top 10 Most Beautiful Countries In The World" width=900 height=591 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-65013 class=wp-caption-text>Top 10 Most Beautiful Countries In The World</p><p>Switzerland is among the top 10 most beautiful countries in the world. The country is a federated nation&nbsp;in central Europe. Bern serves as Switzerland’s administrative capital, and Lausanne is its administrative and judicial hub. Switzerland’s small size (its total area is around half that of Scotland) and low population indicate little about its global importance.</p><p>Switzerland has been luring travellers for ages with its powdered mountains and clear, crisp air. It is frequently thought of as a winter wonderland. The Swiss Alps’ secluded Zermatt is a popular destination for skiers to hit the slopes and soak in the scenery.</p><p>But with its verdant valley forges and emerald lakes, Switzerland is just as gorgeous in the summer. The old city of Bern in this nation is home to some of the most stunning specimens of medieval and Renaissance architecture.</p><p>Throughout the history of the nation, Switzerland’s population has expanded steadily and largely consistently. According to some estimates, growth rates in the 19th and 20th centuries were consistently between 0.7 and 0.8%, and during the course of those decades, the population as a whole doubled.</p><h3>6. Costa Rica</h3><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65014 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Top-10-Most-Beautiful-Countries-In-The-World-costa-rica.jpg alt="Top 10 Most Beautiful Countries In The World" width=730 height=458 sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-65014 class=wp-caption-text>Beautiful Countries of The World</p><p>Costa Rica is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Most people agree that Costa Rica has the most stable and democratic government of any nation in Central America. A fair judicial system, an independent electoral body, and a unicameral legislature are all guaranteed by its 1949 constitution.</p><p>The constitution also disbanded the army, granted women the right to vote, and guaranteed all of its residents important social, economic, and educational protections. Compared to its war-torn neighbours, Costa Rica was able to maintain a reasonable level of peace throughout the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>With a strong educational system from the primary grades through the university level, it boasts one of the highest literacy rates (more than nine-tenths) in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Over the course of its misty river valleys, gorgeous beaches, and unique grasslands, Costa Rica is home to an estimated 500,000 different species. Its native flora and wildlife can flourish and produce a naturally magnificent location because to the environmental protection that covers over a fourth of its territory.</p><p>Beyond its scenery, the Central American nation is also home to a large number of five-star restaurants and spas that assist tourists in winding down after an exciting day.</p><h3>7. Canada</h3><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65015 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Top-10-Most-Beautiful-Countries-In-The-World-Canada.jpg alt width=1024 height=682 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-65015 class=wp-caption-text>Most Beautiful Countries In The World</p><p>Canada, the second-largest country in the world by land (after Russia), takes up nearly the northern half of the North American continent. Despite its size, Canada is one of the least populous nations in the world.</p><p>Within its borders, Canada is home to a huge diversity of geographic elements. Generally speaking, the landform structure of the nation can be compared to a huge basin with a diameter of more than 3,220 miles (5,200 km).</p><p>Toronto, Calgary, Niagara Falls, Ottawa, Banff National Park, Vancouver Island, Quebec City, and Montreal are among Canada’s top tourist destinations. Canada’s largest and busiest national park, Banff, is home to a variety of animals, including bighorn sheep, grizzly bears, wolves, black bears, bison, elk, and bald eagles.</p><p>The largest waterfall in the world, Niagara Falls, is located in Canada and features a breathtaking three-eye waterfall on its border.</p><p>It might be an alternate country for many foreign students, as well as professionals or immigrants. Canada offers a vast array of climates due to its extensive latitudinal range. Climate is significantly influenced by ocean currents, particularly the warm waters of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic and the Alaska Current in the Pacific.</p><h3>8. Tanzania</h3><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Top-10-Most-Beautiful-Countries-In-The-World-tanzania-.jpg alt="Top 10 Most Beautiful Countries In The World" width=730 height=476 sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Tanzania is also one of the top 10 most beautiful countries in the world. The country is an East African nation that is located very close to the Equator. Tanzania became a sovereign state in 1964 after Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which were formerly distinct republics, were united.</p><p>Its natural wealth is nearly unimaginable. Every year, more than a million wildebeest travel across the Serengeti, a protected plain in the north of the nation, in what is known as the Great Migration. In the Ngorongoro Crater’s short-grass plains, rhinos and zebras mix together. And Tanzania’s coastline, which faces the Indian Ocean, has tranquil surroundings and beaches with gleaming white sand.</p><h3>9. Peru</h3><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65017 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Most-Beautiful-Countries-In-The-World-Peru-.jpeg alt="Top 10 Most Beautiful Countries In The World" width=2048 height=1536 sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-65017 class=wp-caption-text>Top 10 Most Beautiful Countries In The World</p><p>With its northernmost point almost reaching the equator, Peru is fundamentally a tropical nation. Despite being located in a tropical region, the extremes in elevation and the southwest winds that blow in across the chilly Peru Current (or Humboldt Current), which flows along its Pacific shoreline, cause a tremendous range of temperatures, lifestyles, and economic activity.</p><p>Many people have heard of the impressive Inca ruins at Machu Picchu, yet that is only a small portion of Peru’s natural beauty. The charming oasis of Huacachina is located in the Ica Desert, and visitors can explore the nearby dunes after spending the night in the little settlement there.</p><p>Vinicunca, a mountain with a rainbow of colours, is located not too far from Machu Picchu’s green top. And no journey to Peru is complete without visiting Lima, the capital city, which is home to a wealth of pre-Columbian art and Colonial-era buildings.</p><h3>10. South Africa</h3><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65018 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Top-10-Most-Beautiful-Countries-In-The-World-South-Africa.jpg alt="Top 10 Most Beautiful Countries In The World" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-65018 class=wp-caption-text>Most Beautiful Countries In The World</p><p>South Africa is one of the world’s most beautiful countries. The country boasts some wonderful panoramic sites, ranging from the beaches along the Indian Ocean in the east to the desert shores in the west, and from the lovely Winelands around Cape Town to the craggy peaks of the Drakensberg.</p><p>The well-known Table Mountain in Cape Town, which has evolved into South Africa’s unofficial national symbol, is the country’s most iconic landmark. But our nation is much more than that. Locals have long understood that South Africa is one of the most gorgeous places on earth, and the rest of the world is slowly catching on.</p><p>The Blyde River Canyon and the Drakensberg Mountains are just a couple of the breathtaking scenery that South Africa has to offer. With all of that, it might be easy to forget that it’s also a nation with plenty of issues and a capital city that should be avoided.</p><p>However, if you escape to the Cape and take your camera to capture everything in between, you’ll be able to enjoy one of the world’s most breathtaking landscapes. South Africa is a desirable destination all year round since its beauty is complemented by its agreeable temperature.</p><p>Winters are brief, and days are frequently pleasant and sunny. Unlike the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere has a winter from November to February. Early spring is the greatest time to go game viewing, but if you want a beach vacation with lots of sunshine, then head to the coast from late October to late November. Around the middle of December, the city’s holiday revellers start to leave in droves, so popular locations, hotels, and resorts will be fully occupied.</p><h2>Top 10 Most Beautiful Countries In The World</h2><p>Here are the&nbsp; top 10 most beautiful countries in the world</p><p>1.
