The children on this show should move far far away from GC as soon as they are old enough. None of them are safe there. It reminds of when I used to watch Murder She Wrote and where Angela Lansbury’s character was invited somewhere, someone died. I told my parents at the time, who would go to an event where she was invited? It was too dangerous; they might end up dead. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/roll_eyes.png title=:roll_eyes: alt=:roll_eyes: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>15 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/g/aca169/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> GiGi44:<p>It reminds of when I used to watch Murder She Wrote and where Angela Lansbury’s character was invited somewhere, someone died.

Harrison was ripped away from the only family he knew, first his mother then his father dies. Kyle and summer take over, remove him from GC , he comes back to gc those parents get divorced and now a lunatic will kidnap him and claire. I hate how this show uses kids for plot driven storylines.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>AnnH</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 11, 2024, 4:26pm <span itemprop=position>8</span></span><p>Wow! Jordan is the new “Sheila Carter” on this show. She has zoned in on the Newmans and won’t let go. Now, she’s nabbed an Abbott so I’m sure Summer will be on a “I told you so!” rant about Claire during that.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>OMG END THIS NOW.</p><p>I guess the writers just ran out of material to rewrite a decades old story like this.</p><p>I wonder what else they plan to pull out of their butts.</p><p><span class=post-likes>10 Likes</span></p><p>I am guessing that Summer will soften towards Claire, because Harrison will be so happy to see her at the party. Once Harrison gets tired and the hour gets late, Kyle will likely take him jome and Summer will (reluctantly?) approve of Claire tucking him in.</p><p>Jordan will see Claire’s interaction and kidnaps them both!</p><p>Now the Newman’s and Abbott’s will point fingers, then be forced to work together.</p><p>Chance is going to be the one to save them endearing Summer to him. Also giving Harrison a serious case of hero worship.</p><p>Harrison will also be more drawn to Claire for taking care of him while in Jordan’s care, and keeping his from being scared.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>kyle and claire did look good together in the pics of the party.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>could be chaos especially if mean ashley is at the party too.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>It just doesn’t make any sense.

I could see a connection there.
