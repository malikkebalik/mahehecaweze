She observed that he might have been trying to teach her that money corrupts, an ethos that “felt true and kind of beautiful and kind of enlightened for somebody like that.”</p><p>But she still struggled with “why he would have taken that value system and applied it so severely to me.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She went on, saying, “You can have a value system and be unable to totally live it,” she added. “And you can imagine being that rich and famous and how amazing it is if you can hold on to some of your value system.

But I feel grateful for it.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Laurene Powell-Jobs said that she’s “not interested in legacy wealth buildings,” and her kids know that.</h2><p>The New York Times profile of Lisa mentioned that Laurene had an inherited fortune in the neighborhood of $21 billion. But by the time the newspaper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">profiled</a> Laurene in 2020, she was worth $27.5 billion and ranked as the 35th wealthiest person in the world.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-jXcwIi jyCgFD"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In her interview with the newspaper, however, Laurene called out the wealth gap in the world. “It’s not right for individuals to accumulate a massive amount of wealth that’s equivalent to millions and millions of other people combined,” she said. “There’s nothing fair about that. We saw that at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries with the Rockefellers and Carnegies and Mellons and Fords of the world. That kind of accumulation of wealth is dangerous for a society. It shouldn’t be this way.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Laurene, who co-founded the education organization College Track and the philanthropic corporation Emerson Collective, indicated that she would give away all the wealth instead of passing it on to her children.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn’t care about the accumulation of wealth,” she said. “I am doing this in honor of his work, and I’ve dedicated my life to doing the very best I can to distribute it effectively, in ways that lift up individuals and communities in a sustainable way. I’m not interested in legacy wealth buildings, and my children know that. Steve wasn’t interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaKukmsOmecmomaxlm56xtHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
