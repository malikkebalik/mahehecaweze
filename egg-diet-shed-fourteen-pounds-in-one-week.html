However, the program has totally phased out this myth. Having allocated a group of hundred people in two categories, the plan executed one simple test. While one group was given one egg in one week, other one was given more than one egg in one day. And past one month, when the influence of their egg consumption on their cholesterol level was noticed, both of them were as hale as they were prior to the test. Moreover, there was no rise or fall in their cholesterol levels. So, if you are stepping away from going ahead with the program while considering it a foe of your heart, you certainly shall alter your wrong assumption and embrace the magnificent plan.</p><h3><b>Nutrition Density of Eggs</b></h3><p>Eggs can aptly be called nutritious food items due to their opulent content of proteins.

Loaded with vitamins, iron, folate, omega-3 fatty acids, and plenty of minerals, nutrition density of eggs cannot be challenged. And since omega-3 fatty acids are not naturally produced in your body, you need to provide them through foods. No other food item indeed can be better than eggs. Besides that, there are twelve vitamins in eggs. Vitamin D plays an important role in increasing the immunity of your body and in making it resilient to combat against terrible diseases such as cancer. The best part of the food item is, it shows the amazing impacts on your body without making you grow fat. The high protein content of eggs upholds you full for longer.
