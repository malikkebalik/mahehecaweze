And I say, ‘Well, I do say it and I feel better for saying it’,” she told The Post.</p><p>The “Dynasty” icon does not shy away from saying <a href=#>what she really thinks about Hollywood</a>, sexism, Ozempic and everything in between.</p><p>“Hollywood has changed a lot because it’s been taken over mostly by corporations, and corporations are the ones that are making the films now and choosing almost as if by rote,” she says, her inimitable British accent still able to cut glass.</p><p>“I don’t know how they choose the subjects to make, but there’s been very few films that I have wanted to go to. I don’t want to be lectured. I don’t want to be taught things … practically every film now has a message, and I am sick of being messaged.”</p><p>She did&nbsp;go to see <a href=#>Margot Robbie’s summer mega-hit</a> “Barbie,” which was all about female empowerment and inclusion.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Fabulous at 90, Joan Collins is three decades older than her fifth husband, Percy Gibson. The two are seen here in 2020. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Collins’ verdict: “I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;it was OK.</p><p>“I didn’t think that the color was very good, frankly. I thought it was kind of muddy. I thought [Robbie] was great, and all the cast was great, but I wasn’t thrilled by it. I didn’t come out singing any of the songs like I did when I saw&nbsp;Gene&nbsp;Kelly or Betty Grable or Carmen Miranda,” she said.</p><p>“But then times have changed … this is what young people want today, I guess.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Joan Collins said she misses her late sister, novelist Jackie Collins (right), and that the two of them mended a rift before Jackie’s death. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>What she really misses, though, are rom-coms.</p><p>“But they are very few and far between,” she said. “As for the sort of thing you’d see with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks in the late ’80s or early ’90, you know, ‘Sleepless in Seattle’ or ‘You’ve Got Mail,’ forget about it. I mean, it would be lacerated, sadly, by the critics as being nothing but fluff. And everybody, it seems, wants to be lectured. And I don’t…entertainment to me is the name of the game.”</p><p>Collins grew up in a showbiz family —&nbsp;her father Joe was a theatrical agent —&nbsp;in London and arrived in Los Angeles while in her early 20s, after being&nbsp;sold as a studio-contract starlet to 20th Century Fox from the&nbsp;UK’s Rank&nbsp;Organization.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins opens up having an abortion after getting pregnant by fiancé Warren Beatty in the early 1960s. <span class=credit>Mirrorpix via Getty Images</span></figure><p>In her new memoir, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Behind the Shoulder Pads</a>,” Collins details how she fought back against the sexual advances of foul and bloated film execs after being warned of Hollywood’s “wolves” by Marilyn Monroe — who was keen to particularly warn her off&nbsp;Daryl Zanuck, then vice-president of production at 20th Century Fox.</p><p>Days later, Collins writes, Zanuck pounced.</p><p>“Breathing cigar fumes over me, he hissed: ‘You haven’t had anyone until you’ve had me, baby. I’m the biggest and the best and I can go all night.’ I was so shocked I couldn’t speak, so I just wriggled free of his groping hands and ran back to the set.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In the 1980s, Collins, far right (with Linda Evans and John Forsythe), became a household name in the US thanks to “Dynasty.”</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins gets dragged through the mud as her most famous character, Alexis Carrington Colby, on “Dynasty.” <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The star also writes of having a harrowing abortion at age 26 after becoming pregnant by her then-fiancé, <a href=#>Warren Beatty</a>.</p><p>She recalls the moment she broke the news to Beatty.</p><p>“‘Pregnant?’ he asked in his puzzled little-boy voice. ‘How did that happen?'” she writes.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins and her son, Sacha Newley. <span class=credit>Alan Chapman/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins and her daughters — Katy Kass (left) and Tara Newley, right, in May 2017. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“‘The butler did it,’ I said sarcastically, ‘or maybe it’s an immaculate conception.’ ‘This is terrible,’ he said….’Terrible!'”</p><p>Collins makes it clear that her career would not have survived had she had her baby.</p><p>She notes that the early 1960s were “dark days for women and girls,” as abortion was practically illegal everywhere.</p><p>Fearful that she would end up in agony in a back-room clinic, Beatty accompanied her to an ex-surgeon in New Jersey.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins —&nbsp;seen at the Vanity Fair Oscars bash in 2022 — says there’s not much she likes to see at the movies these days. <span class=credit>WireImage for Vanity Fair</span></figure><p>On the morning the procedure was scheduled, Collins tried to back out of it. But 23-year-old Beatty, whose own career was just taking off, told her: “Butterfly, we can’t. We can’t do it…having a baby now will wreck both of our careers. You know it will.”</p><p>The actress says she “screamed with rage” in June 2022 when the <a href=#>US Supreme Court overruled</a>Roe v. Wade, eliminating the federal constitutional right to abortion.</p><p>Collins went on to have beloved three children, Tara and Sacha Newley, with her second husband, actor and composer Anthony Newley, and Katy, with third husband, Ron Kass, as well as four grandchildren.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins with her goddaughter, Cara Delevingne (center), and Rita Ora in June 2013. <span class=credit>Dave M.

And it would’ve ruined my career. It would absolutely have ruined my career … a lot of women are made to feel guilty about it, which I think is quite shocking, and made to feel guilty about it by men, thank you very much.</p><p>“Not that I hate men. I don’t. But I do find that it’s none of their bloody business.”</p><p>Collins remains best-known for playing über-bitch Alexis Carrington Colby in “Dynasty,” the hit ’80s nighttime soap opera that made her a household name in the US at age 48.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins and third husband Ron Kass with their family, including his sons from a previous relationship, in Marbella, Spain in 1972. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>When asked about the rise of Hollywood stars who become brands, such as Gwyneth Paltrow with her Goop business, Collins replied: “When I was doing ‘Dynasty,’ I had a million brands. I had hats. I had glasses. I still have glasses or eyewear as they call it. I still have a line of eyewear. I’ve had beauty, makeup, skincare, hats, clothes. I’ve had a million brands.</p><p>“When you’re very popular, which was when I was doing Dynasty, people will want to ask you to do things. But my brand is writing books now. As Sir Michael Caine said to me once — because I said, ‘Why are you opening a restaurant, Michael?’ — he said,’ well, no actor can rely on acting alone to support himself, and you therefore have to have another string to your bow or another thing to do’. And that was some time ago. And that’s when I decided that, yeah, I was going to write books.”</p><p>She’s now on book No. 19.</p><p>Her oeuvre includes novels, autobiographies and books on beauty.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins at her wedding to her first husband, actor Maxwell Reed, in May 1952. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Collins and her second husband, Anthony Newley. <span class=credit>Bettmann Archive</span></figure><p>Collins, who has been happily married to husband Percy Gibson, three decades younger, for more than 21 years, has “no truck” with the modern Hollywood must-haves Ozempic and Botox.</p><p>“Oh the thing that they inject?” she said of Ozempic. “I don’t like any ‘tweakments.'”</p><p>The actress admits she had Botox once, but ran away screaming because she’s “needle-phobic. I just believe in taking care of my skin and wearing lots of makeup.”</p><p>The star dearly misses her sister, Jackie Collins. The famous “Hollywood Wives” novelist died in 2015 at 77, following a secret battle with breast cancer. Collins admitted the two had a rift over her taking up writing, but made up before Jackie died.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized">Collins and her fourth husband Peter Holm were married from 1985 to 1987. <span class=credit>Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“We got it out of the way,” Collins said. “And as I reminded her, when I was an actress and she wanted to be an actress, I encouraged her a lot … She did become an actress for a while, and she changed her name because she didn’t want to be known as Joan’s sister.&nbsp;</p><p>“And so I said, ‘Well, you know, Jackie, when you wanted to be an actress, I encouraged you. So now I’m writing because it’s a source of income for me’. And as you know, actors do not have a very good source of income all their lives, hardly at all. Very few actors are Tom Cruise or Barbara Streisand who make tons of money, you know.”</p><p>And Collins has no plans to retire; she is currently making plans to play Wallis Simpson, the late Duchess of Windsor, in the biopic “In Bed with the Duchess,” which will cover the last 15 years of the American divorcee’s life.</p><p>Said the nonagenarian: “I call myself a working actor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmamxfn7yiuoycpqWkmaPAbr%2FAsqpmr5Gnv6a6jJucmqykrnq1rcuknJ1lmJq%2FbrXNraZmmZKkv7W1zqdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
