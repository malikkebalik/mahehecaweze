With West Ham United, he had won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1999. His greatest successes arrived when he joined London rivals Chelsea FC with whom he won the Premier League title (2004–05, 2005–06, 2009–10), the FA Cup (2006–07, 2009–10), the League Cup (2004–05), and the FA Community Shield (2005). With the club, he had also reached the final of the UEFA Champions League in the 2007–08 season. He had closed out his club career with a brief stint in the North American Soccer League (NASL) with the Tampa Bay Rowdies (2016-2018). In June 2018, he was assigned as the team’s assistant coach while still active as a player. He retired from the sport in November 2018 and took up an academy-level coaching role with Chelsea FC in 2019. At the international level, he had represented England at the Under-16, Under-18, and Under-21 tiers. At the senior tier, he had represented the country at 2002, 2006, and 2010 FIFA World Cups, as well as the Euro 2004. England had made it to the quarter-final stage of each of those tournaments except the 2010 FIFA World Cup where they had been knocked out in the Round-of-16 stage.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Joseph John Cole</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Joe, The Conjuror, King Cole</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Joe-Cole-in-an-Instagram-selfie-from-February-2018.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Scorpio</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Paddington, Westminster, London, England, United Kingdom</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>London, England, United Kingdom</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=English src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/England.png alt=English width=63 height=45 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3></h3><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Soccer Coach, TV Analyst, Former Professional Soccer Player</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/England.png><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Others</strong> – George Cole (Adoptive Father) (Former Market Trader), Susan Cole (Adoptive Mother), Nicky Cole (Adoptive Brother), Charly Cole (Adoptive Sister), Mitchell Cole (Brother-in-Law) (Professional Soccer Player) (d.
