Her introduction would be incomplete without mentioning that she appeared in Australian soap opera Neighbours. Moreover, the talented artist even featured in MTV’s Teen Wolf as <strong>Cora Hale</strong>. The 30-year-old has been actively contributing to the showbiz universe for more than a decade now. Stay with us to know the details regarding her net worth, early life, love life, and career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adelaide_Kane%E2%80%99s_Whopping_Net_Worth_From_Acting_Career></span>Adelaide Kane’s Whopping Net Worth From Acting Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The only reason why Adelaide Kane is globally famous today is because of her works in television shows and movies. Her works on the screen not just guaranteed her tremendous fame but it also brought colossal wealth to her name. Specifically, she gathers a staggering net worth of <strong>$500,000</strong> as of September 2020. Considering her juvenile age, she still has a lot of good years to offer in the industry. Consequently, the day isn’t far when her net worth will touch the <strong>$1 million </strong>mark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-daily-shuffle-1.png><p>Adelaide Kane was always interested in acting, which led her to go to the theatres at first. She was a part of several plays like ‘Oliver!’, ‘Our Day Out’, and ‘Anything Goes.’ Her debut in television was a breakthrough as she played <strong>Lolly Allen </strong>in Australian soap opera, ‘Neighbours.’ Likewise, the diva also appeared in shows like ‘Into the Dark’, and ‘Teen Wolf.’ In 2020, she featured as a guest role of <strong>Hailey Damon</strong> in ‘This is Us.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pinterest-1.jpg><p>Kane even bagged several accolades for her appearances on television. In fact, she received two award nominations in Teen Choice and Monte-Carlo Television Festival for her acting in ‘Reigns.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adelaide_Kane%E2%80%99s_Dating_History_with_Multiple_Boyfriends></span>Adelaide Kane’s Dating History with Multiple Boyfriends<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Adelaide Kane remains vocal about her acting works, she tries her best to keep her romantic life under the radar. However, she fell victim of her own popularity since she couldn’t hide the fact that she is in a romantic relationship. Interestingly, the Australian actor started to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">date fellow actor </a><strong>Jacques Colimon </strong>in July 2019. Surprisingly, the two strengthened their romantic affiliation while working together in ‘Into The Dark.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/perthnow-1.jpg><p>Adelaide Kane hasn’t been quite fortunate when it comes to relationships as she suffered a fair share of break-ups to this date. The 30-year-old dated American actor, Connor Paolo from 2011 to 2013. Following that she was single for a brief time before she went out with ‘Reign’ co-star <strong>Sean Teale</strong>. Sean and Kane’s relationship didn’t last either as they were together for only one year, i.e from 2014 to 2015.</p><p><strong>Also See: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Know all about American comedian Kathleen Madigan’s marriage, dating affairs, and net worth.</a></strong></p><p>Besides actors, Kane even tried her luck by dating an entrepreneur, Joey Pauline in May 2017.

However, despite all the expectations among them and their fans, Adelaide and her boyfriend split up in June 2019.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts_Adelaide_Kane></span>Quick Facts: Adelaide Kane<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Kane is a victim of generalized anxiety disorder and promotes the idea to break the stigma around mental illness.</li><li>She will feature in an upcoming film, ‘Arcana’ as an actress and an executive producer,</li><li>Adelaide was born in Claremont, Perth, Western Australia.</li><li>While her father has Scottish, Irish, and French descent, her mom is Jewish.</li><li>She shares her bloodline with a younger brother, <strong>William</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Who is Mercedes Carrera?
