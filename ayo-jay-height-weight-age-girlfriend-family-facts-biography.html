However, although he loved singing, he was never encouraged by his family to pursue it, the importance being placed on higher education.</li><li>He has revealed that while growing up, he would enjoy singing in the bathroom and when he became interested in Nigerian music, particularly after listening to Wande Coal, he began to think that he would be able to do something similar. He had studied the impact that Wizkid had made and had decided to give it a try.</li><li>Jay has disclosed that he has a shy personality and he was initially unsure about trying to make a career in the music industry as he felt that his introvert nature was not fit for a musician.</li><li>He has affirmed that prior to getting offers from record labels, he had done an internship on Wall Street, and so he would have continued somewhere in that line had he not ventured into music.</li><li>He has stated that he had written and recorded the song Available (2014) in 2 days. In the single, he had intentionally pronounced the word “Available” with an Ibadan accent, as his father had worked in Ibadan for a decade and he used to be a frequent visitor to the city. In the song, he made an attempt to imitate people from that part of the country and has been grateful to find out how people liked the incorporation.</li><li>Ayo has more than 70k followers on Instagram.</li><li>He has credited his affinity for dancehall and Caribbean music to his schooling in New York where he attended college. He has pointed out that as a result of his degree in Economics, he has been able to save and always make smart financial decisions.</li><p>Featured Image by Ayo Jay / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqwqGWalsZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
