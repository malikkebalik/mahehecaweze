The answer was a mixed bag.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Co-executive and actor Glenn Howerton admitted to keeping up with fan reasons on Twitter after the airing of every episode. He said,</p><p>I'm not one of those people who's like, 'I never read your reviews.' I read 'em&nbsp;all. Even the bad ones, I&nbsp;love&nbsp;it.</p><p>&nbsp;While co-star Charlie Day refrained from using social media and admitted himself as being "fragile."</p><p>Olson revealed that she "don't really get any negative response on Twitter," and stated her absence from IMDb. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Also, with her answer, Kaitlin touched upon a message board that previously surfaced on IMDb, which contained a "thread of whether I did or did not have a boob job."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The said thread, which was titled "Implants?" has since become unavailable on the platform.</p><p>Per a report by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bustle</a>, Kaitlin "laughed" and promptly "brushed" the idea of her getting plastic surgery on her chest. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actress, however, gave a decent answer in her defense and cited her motherhood as a possible reason for her breasts to appear relatively bigger.</p><p>I had two babies! Over the span of like three years!&nbsp;It's like, 'Oh she got a boob job!' 'No she got 'em reduced!' 'No, she got a boob job again!' I'm like, I've had two children!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But the actress immediately after yelled, "I had a boob job! Yeah!." Her answer was followed by immediate laughter and rousing applause from the audience.</p><h2>Kaitlin Olson's Was Targeted with Plastic Surgery Claims</h2><p>Around three years ago, the actress's facial attributes&nbsp;were the subject of discussion among online users.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Things got turned on when a Reddit user speculated whether&nbsp;Olson did&nbsp;"something to her face?" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The user further remarked on Olson and said she looked like "a patient of" the surgeon who has performed&nbsp;plastic surgery on&nbsp;other celebrities.</p><p>A flurry of replies followed that. "100% agree. Her eyebrows do not move when she talks. At all. Her emotions are indiscernible when looking at her face," commented one user.</p><p>While another user wrote, "She looks terrifying? Her lips and eyes make her look monstrous, her face doesn't move and her lips are too big for her face."</p><p>"Just look at her lips and her eyebrows. She has been stretched tighter than an unemployment check. The part between her nose and lips is plastic," remarked another one.</p><h2>Before & After: Kaitlin Olson Underwent Surgery on Her Face, But There's a Catch</h2><p>While Olson preferring plastic surgery to possibly de-age herself was hot on the heels, the actress presented some light on the subject during her chat with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Glamour</a>&nbsp;in 2017.</p><p>During the sitting, Olson was asked about the serious bike accident that resulted in her getting a fractured skull. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Olson called her accident to be "doozy," and provided an honest assessment of the topic, as she said,</p><p>I also smashed my face and had to have surgery. It was bad, it was really, really bad.&nbsp;No 12 or 13-year-old girl wants to walk into her first day of junior high with a swollen face and a shaved head and a [huge] scar. It was bad.</p><p>In her recollection, Olson, who was aged 12 at the time of the accident, also stated how some of her classmates were "really mean," toward her during the time.</p><p>The surgery was aimed to close down the gaping wound—which resulted in her living with a permanent hole— at the back of her head. She disclosed to the magazine that she also had to get surgery for her fractured face, She said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Yeah, that was a doozy. I still have a hole in my head. It was the size of a lime. Now it’s the size of a quarter. It was bad. I had my head shaved, and this was all going into junior high school. I also smashed my face and had to have surgery. It was bad, it was really, really bad. Honestly, it’s probably the greatest thing that ever happened to me. That was a real serious source of adversity that took years to fight back from that. No 12 or 13-year-old girl wants to walk into her first day of junior high with a swollen face and a shaved head and a [huge] scar. It was bad.</p><p>As per Olson, it was her sense of humor that helped her through the recovery period from the reconstructive plastic surgery for which she had to go through the knife for various sessions.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>What is Kaitlin&nbsp;Olson's Net Worth?</h2><p>According to<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> Celebritynetworth</a>, Olson has an estimated net worth of $50 million.</p><h2>How old is Kaitlin Olson?</h2><p><strong>You May Read:</strong><strong><a href=# rel=follow>&nbsp;Does Kaitlin Olson Have Any Siblings?</a></strong></p><p>Born on 18 August&nbsp;1975 (age 47) in Portland, Oregon, U.S.,&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaitlin Willow Olson was born to publisher Donald Lee Olson and nurse Melinda Leora.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKORnsGttc1mpqWrn6N6sbjArKuim12owrOzxKuwZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
