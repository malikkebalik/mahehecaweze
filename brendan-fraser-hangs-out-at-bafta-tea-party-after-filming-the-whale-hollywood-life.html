The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>talented actor</a> posed on the red carpet of the event in a light gray suit and dark blue tie as well as black shoes. He also rocked a pair of glasses and gave a smile to cameras capturing the epic moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brendan-Fraser-weight-loss-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>In addition to posing solo, Brendan posed with his gorgeous partner <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jeanne Moore</strong></a>. She wore a long sleeveless red dress and had her long blonde hair down as she held onto his arm and flashed a big smile. She also held silver clutch purse and added light-colored pointy heels to her look.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Brendan’s BAFTA appearance comes after he made lasting impressions with his role of Charlie, a 600-pound English teacher who is looking to reconnect with his 17-year-old estranged daughter. The film is based on 2012 play written by Samuel D. Hunter, and Brendan had to gain weight and wear a fat suit to transform into the right size to play the character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Brendan-Fraser-the-whale-ev-embed.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I developed muscles I did not know I had,” he told journalists, including one for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>, at a press conference in Venice in Sept., ahead of the movie’s world premiere. “I even felt a sense of vertigo at the end of the day when all the appliances were removed; it was like stepping off the dock onto a boat in Venice. That [sense of] undulating. It gave me appreciation for those whose bodies are similar. You need to be an incredibly strong person, mentally and physically, to inhabit that physical being.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Darren Aronofsky</strong>, who directed The Whale, also explained why he chose Brendan to play the incredible part, even though he had been out of the public eye for a while. “It took me 10 years to make the movie and that’s because it took me 10 years to cast the film. Casting Charlie was a huge challenge for many different reasons,” he explained.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I considered everyone — all types of different actors, every single movie star on the planet. But none of them ever really clicked,” he continued. “It just didn’t move me, or feel right. A couple years ago, I caught a trailer from a Brazilian movie, a low-budget [movie], and I <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>saw Brendan</a> in the trailer and a lightbulb went off. I hadn’t seen ‘Gods and Monsters’ or ‘George of the Jungle.’ Seeing him in there, it just clicked. I asked Brendan to come meet me…it just kept clicking.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Brendan’s impactful role led to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a nomination</a> for a Golden Globe Award. Although he didn’t end up winning, the star never planned on going to the ceremony. “I have more history with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association than I have respect for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ </a>magazine last year, referring to a previous claim he made about being sexually assaulted by former HFPA president <strong>Philip Berk</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5BuZpuqlaOxorqMn6maq5WneqOtxa2YZqyVlnqxrdGtsGaomKTBsL%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
