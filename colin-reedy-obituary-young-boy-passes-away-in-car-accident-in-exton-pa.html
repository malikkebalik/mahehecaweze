The 25-year-old, described as one of the kindest, most generous, and positive souls, lost his life in a motor vehicle accident in Chester County on Friday, October 20.</p><p>Colin was more than just a firefighter; he was a shining example of love and selflessness. His warm heart and willingness to help others endeared him to everyone he met. Friends and family remember him as a sweet little boy who grew into a remarkable young man, always ready to engage in conversations, especially about his passion for cars.</p><p>Rick Carkner of West Sand Lake, New York, expressed his deep sadness at the loss, reminiscing about their shared love for automobiles and the bond they shared over the years. Colin‚Äôs unwavering love for people and his family was evident to all who knew him, leaving a void that can never be filled.</p><p>Rick Carkner shared a post on fb on the death of Colin Reedy:</p><p>Heartbroken by the loss of my nephew Colin Reedy. Colin was the kindest, most generous, self-sacrificing, happiest, strongest, and one of the most positive souls I have ever met. I adored you Colin ever since you were a sweet little baby boy. Always near me when you were little, always talking. Our bond was cars, and I looked forward to every conversation about them as you grew older. I love this pic below with you. You were filled with God‚Äôs love for everyone and everything and would do anything for anyone. I am so sad that I won‚Äôt be able to see you grow older and raise children of your own. My heart is absolutely broken for all of my in-laws and the entirety of this most absolutely wonderful family that I have been honored and joyed and blessed to be a part of for the past 25 years. I will stand by you unconditionally with all of my love. God saw fit to take you from us at only 25 Colin, and I fear I‚Äôll never understand it, but I WILL see you again someday I promise you brother. I love you little buddy. Please pray for my brother and sister in law Brian Reedy and Tracy Reedy. We will all remain at your side through this. üò¢‚ù§Ô∏èüôè</p><p>The entire community stands in solidarity with Colin‚Äôs family, offering unconditional support and love during this devastating time. The loss of such a vibrant and caring young soul has left a profound impact, and Exton will forever remember Colin Reedy as a local hero and an inspiration to all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ksLC4yKdkq52VmcZuu8Giq66Zoq56urvUp55mmp%2BuerGt0qycrGWRrK66ecinZJyZomKupK%2FInZynrF2eu26x162mp2Wglnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
