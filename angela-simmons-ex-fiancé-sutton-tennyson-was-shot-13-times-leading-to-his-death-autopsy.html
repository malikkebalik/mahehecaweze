As per Tennyson's recently released autopsy report, done by the Fulton County Medical Examiner, he was fatally shot 13 times before he succumbed to the injuries.</p><p>As per the documents obtained by <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>, Tennyson received nine gunshots that penetrated him, while four managed to graze or cut him. He was reportedly shot in his arms, legs, stomach, and chest, out of which three gunshot wounds did an “enormous amount of damage” to his heart.</p><p>The medical reports also said that several gunshots also pierced Tennyson’s spleen and stomach.</p><p>Tennyson was <a href=#>found </a>dead with multiple gunshot wounds outside his garage on November 3 last year. Atlanta police shared at the time that he was seen talking to another man in his driveway before he was shot.</p><p>It appeared as if his death was a result of a home invasion robbery and it was also reported that the suspect fled in his car. Less than a week after Tennyson's death, Michael Williams from Atlanta, surrendered himself to local police for the crime.</p><p>After the 44-year-old was taken into custody, police charged him with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and murder. Williams' attorney, Jackie Patterson, said that not only did his client deny all accusations against him, he also intended to fight the charges and prove his innocence.</p><p>“We are fighting this case vigorously, all the way to a jury trial,” Patterson said, noting that murder cases typically take between one to three years to make a verdict. “It’s gonna be a long process.”</p><p>Tennyson and Simmons, the daughter of Run DMC's Rev. Run, welcomed a son, Sutton Tennyson Jr., in 2016 before splitting in 2017. The 'Growing up Hip Hop' star took to social media to share a series of emotional tributes to Sutton a day after news of his death went viral.</p><p>She posted a picture of her ex and their son and captioned the image, "Thank you for leaving behind my greatest gift I’m hurting. I’m numb. Thank you for the outpouring [sic] of love everyone. I can't believe I'm even saying Rest In Peace Sutton. I promise to hold SJ down in every way I promise."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/262858bf-2494-4481-a3eb-027a12d77ca8.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq6WpwbC6jK2cp6apqLyvecCnnp6kkWLAqrnMqKWsZZWteqe1wKeanmWRqsGwvNKyZKudoKS%2FtXnRnq2emZyasQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
