He kept the Boram Mart contract hidden from the boys and is currently attempting to sell it to someone.</p><p>This raises questions about the contract’s terms regarding Mart ownership. Who is he talking to on the phone?</p><p>Furthermore, one might wonder if Mr. Park, the sweet potato farmer, will play a more significant role in the series, or if his appearance is merely a challenge to Ho-rang’s decision regarding the Mart’s fate.</p><p>Since the boys are still gaining experience in running the Mart, it’s likely that more challenges will arise. We eagerly await to see how they handle these challenges in the upcoming episodes of CEO-dol Mart (Boss Dol Mart).</p><p><strong>Read Previous Episode:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO-dol Mart (Boss Dol Mart) Kdrama Episode 1 Recap & Review</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilqam1qMXAmqVnm5%2BifKSxzmabqKRdoq6zwIykm6uZnZZ6przIrKadnV1nerOxwpqnZqqVq7amw44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
