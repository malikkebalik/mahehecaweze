Um, felt like a dream. I never thought I would be that guy.”</p><p>Black said he was distraught over child custody issues with both women, saying “sh-t has been real crazy,” and that he couldn’t go to prison.</p><p>“The person that really started my depression and all of this is my ex-wife,” Black continued. “So, she next. And then I’m going to do myself, too. But I just wanted to say this to people: Don’t play with people’s emotions, man. Don’t lie on these men.”</p><p>Black’s&nbsp;42-year-old&nbsp;ex-wife then comes to her doorway, the video shows before suddenly cutting out.</p><p>“Oh, here’s my ex-wife right now,” Black says flatly.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Rajaee Shareef Black claimed to be distraught over child custody issues with both his girlfriend and ex-wife. <span class=credit>Facebook/Jay Black</span></figure><p>Police said Black fatally shot the woman moments later before turning the gun on himself.
