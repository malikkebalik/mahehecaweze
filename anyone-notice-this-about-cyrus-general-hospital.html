Could it be that he has had voice lessons of some kind? I don’t know anything about his origins or ethnicity but I have read that many times actors who normally speak with an accent (sometimes a southern accent) will take voice lessons to rid themselves of that accent. Or it could be that is just the way he speaks. Anyway, I like him.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I like him too, just wondering. I hope he’s around for a while.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I think Cyrus will be a great character. Wonder who his leading lady will be? I`m thinking Nelle.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>No!! He’s too old for her. Even if he wasn’t he’s too smart and StreetWise for her…Nelle preys on the vulnerable love struck guys, Cyrus would kill her in a flash if she tried to mess with him.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>But would Cyrus just want too be with Nelle, too get under Sonny<code>s skin. I don</code>t think he is too old,plus he could be valable to Nelle. He must have mob money, and give Nelle power. Two mob wives, at each others throats.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>For me, that’s what would make it so hilarious.

And Yes…the Guy is very careful in the way he speaks…Me like him as well…</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Maybe he’s a trained stage actor. They have to emote and enunciate their words. Speaking of enunciate, maybe Sam could take lessons from him. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rofl.png title=:rofl: alt=:rofl: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I looked him up, Alice3477, & yes, Jeff Kober performed in 5 stage plays! I’ve seen him (younger) in a lot of TV shows & movies, too—usually as a bad guy. Hmmm, might be getting a little typecasted! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png title=:grinning: alt=:grinning: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Since I’m not really liking Cyrus Renault, I was not happy to learn that I’m a little more connected to Jeff than I’d like—he was born in Billings, MT (I’m in Butte, 224 miles from Billings) & I’m almost a month & a half OLDER than him (me, November 5, 1953–Jeff, December 18, 1953)! NOPE, not liking the connection at all! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png title=:laughing: alt=:laughing: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png title=:laughing: alt=:laughing: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png title=:laughing: alt=:laughing: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Well, maybe one bright spot in your connection to Cyrus: I think he’s got gorgeous eyes and is quite handsome so that speaks well of Montana men. There must be some good genes in that part of the country of which I am sure you received. Does that help any? <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png title=:sweat_smile: alt=:sweat_smile: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I know he’s been in a lot of stuff but the only thing I can actually personally remember seeing him on was the movie enough but I’m sure I’ve seen him in more and just don’t recall.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Perhaps due to some hearing problems he has a hearing aid if you noticed when the camera was showing Laura or Carly and it was showing back of cyrus he has a hearing aid</p><p>I wear hearing aids and i tend to pronounce words different than others in my family</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/d/a87d85/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Diva4adayredux:<p>There must be some good genes in that part of the country of which I am sure you received.
