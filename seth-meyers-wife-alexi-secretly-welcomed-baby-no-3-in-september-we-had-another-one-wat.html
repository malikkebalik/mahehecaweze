Her two big brothers excitingly jumped around in their turkey costumes while wishing everyone a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Happy Thanksgiving”</a> before sitting on a couch with their baby sister between them. She was also dressed like a turkey and they covered her face with part of the costume at first before counting down and shouting “SURPRISE!” as they lifted the piece up and showed her to the world for the first time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Seth-Meyers-and-wife-alexi-welcome-baby-3-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“We had another one, you guys!” Seth said after the clip ended before explaining the special meaning behind her name with his mom. “Her name is Adelaide, Addy, after my mother,” Hillary said while smiling from ear to ear.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I knew, knowing Seth and Alexi, it had to start with an A, it had to be a cool name and I know what family means to all of them, so I thought I pretty much had it and [guessed], but I didn’t know and I didn’t want to ask,” she continued. “[When I found out], I burst into tears.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-6></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by @sethmeyers</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Seth and Alexi were married in 2013 and have been happy to share moments in their personal lives on Seth’s show every now and then as well as social media, like in the pic above.
