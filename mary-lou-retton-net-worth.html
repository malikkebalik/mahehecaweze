She represented her native country at the Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, USA in 1984. There, she became the first non – Eastern European gymnast who won a gold Olympic medal in the individual all-around competition. What is more, she was also the first American gymnast who won this medal. Furthermore, after winning 5 medals overall she became the athlete who has taken home the biggest number of Olympic medals (1 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze medals). Retton retired from the professional sport in 1985.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Mary Lou Retton? It has been reported that the outright size of her wealth is as much as $5.8 million, as of the data presented in 2016. Gymnastics is the main source of Retton net worth and fame.</p><h3>Mary Lou Retton Net Worth $5.8 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the girl was raised in Fairmont, West Virginia. She was educated at Fairmont Senior High School, yet she did not graduate. It was Nadia Comaneci who inspires Mary to take up gymnastics. Retton was trained by Béla Károlyi and Márta Károlyi. She began to make herself known in the USA scene in 1983, but missed the world championships (1983) because of a wrist injury. It was thought that a knee injury which she suffered just before the Olympic Summer Games in 1984, could possibly reduce the performance of the gymnast. However, Retton managed to achieve great results in the Olympics held in the USA. It should be noted that Mary Lou not only became a famous athlete but also significantly increased her net worth. Because of the great performance in the Olympic Games, she was named the sportswoman of the year by Sports Illustrated magazine in 1984. Furthermore, a street and a park were named after her in the hometown Fairmont in 1990. Mary Lou Retton stood in the top 10 of the most admired public figures and she was inducted in the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997.</p><p>Moreover, Retton was the first gymnast who performed so called “The Retton Flip” the element which is performed on the uneven bars. It is a giant swing in which the gymnast (with the hips tantamount) lies in wait and then this resistance is used to prosecute her exercise in the other direction and after a somersault to sit on the high shelf. After the retirement, Retton appeared in several television commercials, television series (including “Mary Lou’s Flip Flop Shop”) and the film “Scrooged” and “Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult” . She also wrote a book. Mary is involved in several charities as well as is the motivational speaker and often gives the commentary at gymnastics competitions.</p><p>Finally, the personal life of the former gymnast, Retton is married to American Football quarterback Shannon Kelley and they have four daughters. Currently, the family resides in Houston (since 2012).</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=23.822373696872><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Mary Lou Retton</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5.8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 24, 1968</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Fairmont, West Virginia, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>4 ft 9 in (1.45 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>93 lbs (42 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Gymnast, Women's artistic gymnast , spokeswoman, television personality for commercial endorsements</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Fairmont Senior High School, West Virginia University, University of Texas at Austin</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Shannon Kelley (m. 1990-)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>McKenna Lane Kelley, Shayla Rae Kelley, Emma Jean Kelley, Skyla Brae Kelley</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Ronnie Retton</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Mary-Lou Retton , Mary Retton , Mary Lou Rotunda</td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/marylouretton</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0720574</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23880597014925><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mary-lou-retton-mn0001012264</a></td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Awards</td><td>Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year (1984), Associated Press Athlete of the Year (1984), American Cup (1983, winner),1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (gold medal), American Cup all around competition (1985)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>"Sportswoman of the Year" (Sports Illustrated magazine, 1984)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>"Scrooged", "Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult" (1985),"Baywatch: The Child Inside" (1993)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>TV Shows</td><td>"ABC Funfit" (1985), "Mary Lou's Flip Flop Shop" (2002), "Dairy Queen" (2011), RadioShack "Phone Call" (2014, Super Bowl)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Short stature, just like most gymnasts</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Athletic figure</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Brown Hair</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=18><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Gave birth to her fourth daughter named Emma [2002]</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>First American female gymnast to win the Olympic all-around</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>3</td><td>1984 Olympics: team silver, all-around gold, vault silver, uneven bars bronze, floor exercise bronze</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>4</td><td>Retton's family changed their name from Rotundo to Retton upon their arrival at Ellis Island.
