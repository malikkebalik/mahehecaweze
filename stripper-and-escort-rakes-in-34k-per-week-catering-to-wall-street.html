This past June, Lee raked in $47,200 in one week.</p><p>But the big spenders tend to require her services more frequently toward the end of the year, resulting in her hefty weekly haul.</p><p>“I think it’s a combination of the cold weather and holiday parties that bring out more clients,” Lee told<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Business Insider</a>.</p><p>“And a decent number of them don’t really like spending time with their families, so they’re looking for an escape.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Lee said she is able to seamlessly transition from moonlighting as an executive’s girlfriend or being hired for a one-night stand. <span class=credit>Penelope Dario</span></figure><p>The one-time forensic accountant, who came to the US from China at a young age, revealed that she surprises her clients with her knowledge of financial affairs.

The cheapest option is a minimum one-hour session that goes for $1,300.</p><p>Lee offers couples dates or same-day booking for an additional $500.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">This past June, Lee raked in $47,200 in one week. <span class=credit>Penelope Dario</span></figure><p>Wall Street jet-setters who want to whisk Lee away have to foot the bill for the flight, accommodations and ground transportation.</p><p>Domestic trips range from $7,000 to $12,000 and the price tag gets higher if they want to take her out of the country.</p><p>Trips to South America and Europe cost $20,000 at a minimum; and everywhere else is at least $30,000.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Lee says she had a colorful career in finance. <span class=credit>Penelope Dario</span></figure><p>Aside from earning cash as a stripper and escort, Lee is the creator of her own YouTube channel called “Money Talks with Mia Lee” in which she offers financial advice.</p><p>She readily admits that her psychopathic tendencies enable her to shut off any empathy — which means she can focus on maximizing her time and money-earning hours while enjoying herself.</p><p>Lee also spends significant sums of money to maintain her appearance — including reportedly $10,000 for removal of all of her body hair, $100 every three weeks for eyelash extensions and $3,900 for miraDry, a sweat-eliminating treatment that mitigates the need for constant showering.</p><p>“Escorting is touch and go,” she told The Post. “It all goes up and down.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmanBfl8K0tc2eqqxno6m%2FqrzPnqlmmZ6Zeqa%2FwqiprWWilrimv4yipWZrZKB6sbHRZq6enZtisKLAxKugp59dqbxuw8Clo2arpKeypsCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
