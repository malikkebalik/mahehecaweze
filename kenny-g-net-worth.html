Quite possibly the most popular contemporary instrumentalist, Kenny G’s discography includes collaborations with such giants of music as <a href=#>Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href=#>Natalie Cole</a>, <a href=#>Michael Bolton</a> and <a href=#>Aretha Franklin</a>, and he’s even worked with then-rapper <a href=#>Will Smith</a> and his duet partner, <a href=#>DJ Jazzy Jeff</a>. With all that in mind, it’ll come as no surprise that Kenny G’s net worth is as large as it is – or that it looks set to continue growing.</p><p>So just how rich is Kenny G? According to authoritative sources, Kenny G’s staggering record sales and various collaborations with other world-famous stars have netted him an estimated net worth of $50 million.</p><h3>Kenny G Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>Kenny G has had an affinity for his instrument of choice – the saxophone – since his very earliest days. Attributing his first experience of the instrument to hearing it on “The Ed Sullivan Show”, Kenny G started playing when the future legendary instrumentalist was just ten years old. Nowadays, it might come as a surprise to hear that Kenny G once had trouble getting into his high school’s jazz band – it took Kenny two tries, but that did nothing to deter him. This determination paid off, as Kenny G’s first professional gig came when he was still in high school – he managed to land a part in composer and songwriter <a href=#>Barry White’s</a> “Love Unlimited Orchestra”. Afterwards, various bands would follow, until Kenny G signed his first contract with the record label “Arista Records” as a solo performer. However, although very keen on the possibility of a music career, Kenny G didn’t neglect his studies, and graduated magna cum laude from the University of Washington in 1977 with a degree in accounting.</p><p>Since his debut in his teens, Kenny G has released a number of albums that went on to great success. Typically classified as a smooth jazz performer, Kenny G has been a consistent best seller throughout his career – his second and third albums, “G Force” and “Gravity”, were already successful hits, going on to become platinum in the US. Future albums sold even better, including Kenny’s sixth album, “Breathless” – which became the most commercially successful instrumental album in history, selling 15 million copies and certainly giving Kenny G’s net worth a massive boost on the way. By 2000, Kenny G was already being invited to perform in the White House. It is worth noting another big reason for Kenny G’s impressive net worth – the saxophone legend has recorded several songs aimed primarily at the ever-growing Chinese market. In fact, Kenny G’s greatest hit ever is probably the odd story of his song “Going Home” – which is used across China to signify the end of various businesses, from television programmes to train stations and shopping malls.</p><p>In his personal life, today, Kenny G lives in Malibu, California. Kenny G married Lyndie Benson-Gorelick in 1992, and they have two sons together. Unfortunately, the couple separated in 2012 when Kenny G filed for a divorce.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=33.37015635622><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kenny G</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$50 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 5, 1956</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Seattle, Washington, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 1 in (1.57 m)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Composer, Musician, Record producer, Songwriter, Saxophonist</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Education</td><td>Sharples Junior High School, Franklin High School, University of Washington,</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Noah Gorelick, Max Gorelick</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Parents</td><td>Morris Gorelick, Evelyn Gorelick, Forever in Love, Songbird, The Moment, Merced, CA, United States, Brooks, CA, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Brian Gorelick</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Kenneth Gorelick , Kenny G. , Kenneth Bruce Gorelick , G Kenny</td></tr><tr readability=0.42105263157895><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/KennyG</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/officialkennyg</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4390243902439><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/kennyg</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38888888888889><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/kennyg</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299871</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition (1994), American Music Award for Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist (1994), Soul Train Music Award for Best Jazz Album (1994, 1989), NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Jazz Artist (1998)</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>“Arista Records”</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Albums</td><td>"Kenny G Live", “G Force”, “Gravity”, "Kenny G -Greatest Hits" (1997), "The Very Best of Kenny G" (1994), "Breathless" (1992), "The Moment" (1996)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nominations</td><td>Guinness Book of World Records (Longest note ever recorded on a saxophone, 1997), 25th highest-selling artist in America (RIAA, 2006)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>"The Bodyguard", "The Shadow", "Miracle on 34th Street"</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Love Unlimited Orchestra”</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>His long curly hair</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Complex soprano saxophone songs</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=56.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>I approach everything in my life the same way; if it feels right, I know it.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>What is music anyway?
