However, he isn’t the only one in his family who is active in the entertainment industry, and his father is actually a&nbsp;hugely popular comedian. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Who Is Mike Wayans Father?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Mike's father is none other than the legendary Damon Wayans. Damon has had a very successful career as a writer, actor, and comedian.&nbsp;Over the multiple decades that he has been active, he has earned various accolades for his work, including&nbsp;Emmy nominations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Damon Wayans Turned To Comedy Because Of His Club Foot</h2><p>On September 4, 1960, Damon was born in New York City as the third of 10 children of Elvira Alethia and Howell Wayans. As a young kid, he was ostracized by other children because of his club foot, and he turned to humor to cope with the situation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His disability was corrected using numerous surgeries, but he dropped out in the 9th grade to follow his older brother Keenen to Hollywood. He started becoming active in the L.A. stand-up scene in 1982 and slowly made his way up.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Finding Fame</h2><p>In 1985, Damon earned a regular&nbsp;slot on Saturday Night Live. He left SNL the next year and acted in several productions. He went on to find major fame as an actor in 1988 after appearing as an alien alongside <a href=# rel=follow>Jeff Goldblum</a> and Jim Carrey in Earth Girls Are Easy.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Damon co-starred and wrote for the Emmy Award-winning series In Living Color starting 1990. Over the next four years, he appeared in over 80 episodes and created sketch characters like Homey the Clown, Handiman, and Blaine Edwards. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His writing for In Living Color earned him two personal Emmy nominations. Some of his other well-known works are Damon (1998), My Wife and Kids (2000-2005), The Underground (2006), and Lethal Weapons (2016-2019). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Was Previously Married To Lisa Thorner</h2><p>Damon was previously married to former actress and model Lisa Thorner. The two tied the knot on April 24, 1984, and welcomed four children during their sixteen years of marriage — Damon Wayans Jr., Michael Wayans, Cara Mia Wayans, and Kyla Wayans.</p><p>Unlike Damon, who is still very much in the spotlight, Thorner&nbsp;has stayed&nbsp;away for a long time now. And though he is a public figure, he usually&nbsp;refrained from talking about himself for a long time. That was until he opened up about how his views had changed when <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking with Sun-Sentinel</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>As I’ve gotten older and wiser, I’ve come to realize it is a necessary part of the business. You have to do interviews to let people know who you are. There are a lot of misconceptions about who I am, and I want to correct that.</p><p>Damon, his ex-wife, and his children, including Mike, were&nbsp;featured in My Wife and Kids,&nbsp;which he executive produced and starred in.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWZoLJuw8CymKerXZuutbTEq2WhrJ2h</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
