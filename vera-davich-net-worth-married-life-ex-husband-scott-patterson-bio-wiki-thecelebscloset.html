Vera Davich is someone who belongs to the same category, despite the fact that her marriage with ex-husband Scott Patterson is already over. The diva tied the knot with Alien Nation: Dark Horizon Scott Patterson in a proper wedding ceremony in&nbsp;1985.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/whodatedwho-1.jpg><p>The high-profile wedding was the only reason why Vera Davich rose to prominence in the first place.

According to estimates, she owns a massive net worth of <strong>$100,000 </strong>as of&nbsp;2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/oint-1.jpg><p>On the other hand, Vera’s ex-husband is a multi-millionaire who<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;gathers a colossal net worth&nbsp;</a>of&nbsp;<strong>$15 million&nbsp;</strong>as of&nbsp;2020.
