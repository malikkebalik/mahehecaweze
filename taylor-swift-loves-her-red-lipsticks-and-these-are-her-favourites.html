Be it on dates or on tour—the 33-year-old has rarely ever been spotted wearing any other shade on her lips, and has made it her signature over the course of her career. In fact, the singer-songwriter loves red lipsticks so much that she’s even mentioned it in the lyrics of some of her tunes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/in.hellomagazine.com/images/0286-19561b7dac6b-7d1fd3760625-1000/vertical-480/celebrity-sightings-in-new-york-july-30-2014.jpg><p data-score=120>The beauty world has always been conflicted when it comes to the classic red lip. While a lot of people agree with the idea of wearing red for dressier-occasions, very few are of the opinion that you can wear the shade no matter where you’re going. The obvious reason for this unpopular opinion is that, besides being a bold choice, the shade is also more susceptible to smudging and ruining your entire make-up look. But given how often T-Swift subscribes to her signature look, these issues must be extremely manageable. And we think, this has everything to do with the lipsticks she uses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/in.hellomagazine.com/images/0286-1950ba6f9880-f2990043e3fd-1000/vertical-480/65th-grammy-awards-arrivals.jpg><p data-score=54>For many years now, Swifties have been trying to find the answer to which is the exact red lipstick Taylor Swift wears, but there hasn’t no concrete one answer yet. And that’s probably because Taylor wears different hues of reds, at different occasions.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/in.hellomagazine.com/images/0286-19561b7dac6b-660711926e27-1000/square-480/celebrity-sightings-in-new-york-october-15-2023.jpg><p data-score=164>For example, for some time now Swift allegedly swears by Pat McGrath’s LiquiLUST Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick in the shade Elson 4. In fact, some reports also suggest that the singer wore it during her date around New York City with her new beau, Travis Kelce. And, it must be a good choice because this formula comes with a matte finish that will not budge, come what may. In fact, the cosmetics company even created the ‘Taylor-Made’ Lip Kit in collaboration with the pop star, after the two worked together for her <a href=# title="“Bejeweled” music video">“Bejeweled” music video</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/in.hellomagazine.com/images/0286-1950ba6f9880-8c5df66bc328-1000/horizontal-480/mac-ruby-woo-collage-u66745053743xbk-jpeg.jpg><p data-score=86>Some other red lipsticks that Taylor Swift is said to have used and loved over the years are MAC’s Ruby Woo and the NARS Matte Lip Pencil in Dragon Girl. Taylor has also revealed in past interviews that her hack to making her lipstick stay in place and last long is that after applying the lipstick, she uses a piece of tissue paper between her lips to blot them and sometimes, also brushes on some translucent powder on top.</p><p data-score=34>With <i>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</i> releasing, there is no better time to channel that icon energy by emulating Swift’s signature look, no matter where you go.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnmO1prjLqKSan5Gvtq%2BxjZympmeSmq62wNhoaWlqY2Z9c4OSaWpvaWVkwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecWaraitop7BpnnRnptmpJmlwLW1wqSqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
