If Skellige is ruled by Cerys or Hjalmar:</h3><p>This path will be active if you've completed the "<a href=#>King's Gambit</a>" quest, and Cerys or Hjalmar became King of Skellige.</p><h3 class=he-c>1.1. Ask Crach where Ermion is.</h3><p>You'll find Crach in the port where he'll be observing the Nilfgaardian fleet through a telescope. He'll tell you that Ermion went to see Madman Lugos.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/ask-crach-where-ermion-is.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Ask Crach where Ermion is." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>1.2. Talk to Ermion. / Defeat Lugos' men. / Talk to Ermion outside of Madman Lugos' territory.</h3><p>Go to Madman Lugos' castle. When you get there, you'll find Ermion and Lugos arguing with each other. Your arrival will only make the situation worse and after a while Lugos will attack you.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/talk-to-ermion.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Talk to Ermion. / Defeat Lugos' men. / Talk to Ermion outside of Madman Lugos' territory." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>First you will have to kill Madman Lugos (28), then you and Ermion will have to reach the main gate, killing a dozen of his warriors (28) along the way, and then run down the road until you reach a safe place. There you can ask Ermion about the sunstone and he will point out the people who can help you.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/talk-to-ermion-outside-of-madman-lugos-territory.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Talk to Ermion. / Defeat Lugos' men. / Talk to Ermion outside of Madman Lugos' territory." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>2. If Skellige is ruled by Svanrige Tuirseach:</h3><p>This path will be active if Skellige is ruled by Svanrige Tuirseach.</p><h3 class=he-c>2.1. Talk to Ermion.</h3><p>Go to the Kaer Trolde castle. In the main hall of the castle, Svanrige, being influenced by his mother, is going to sign a treaty with the Nilfgaard. At the last minute, however, he will change his mind and kill the Nilfgaardian messenger. The fight against the Nilfgaardian soldiers (29) will begin. When you kill them all, you will be able to talk to Ermion, who will point you to people who can help you find the sunstone.</p><h3 class=he-c>3. Talk to the bard known as Eyvind.</h3><p>The first person who should know something about the stone is bard Eyvind. You'll find him on a hill to the west of <a href=#>Arinbjorn</a>, from where he's looking for the legendary whale. Tell him you're <strong>gathering material for an adventure novel</strong>, and then he' ll tell you where you should continue your search. If you mention Ermion to him, he'll tell you nothing.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/talk-to-the-bard-known-as-eyvind.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Talk to the bard known as Eyvind." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>4. Find and talk to the pearl diver.</h3><p>You can also go to the place where pearl divers are staying and get the necessary information from them. To do so, go to the place marked on the map, located on the islands north of <a href=#>Arinbjorn</a>. There you will find a boat of pearl divers.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/find-and-talk-to-the-pearl-diver-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Find and talk to the pearl diver." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Dive and swim through an underwater entrance to a nearby cave. There you will find two pearl divers from whom you will learn about a cave where you should continue your search. When you finish talking, a few drowners (29) will appear in the cave after a while, so either leave the cave quickly or just kill them.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/find-and-talk-to-the-pearl-diver-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Find and talk to the pearl diver." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>5. Talk to Yennefer.</h3><p>Go back to the Kaer Trolde port and talk to Yennefer, Ciri and Philippa. Ciri will tell you about Avallac'h's mysterious lab she wants to visit and ask you to go there with her and Yennenfer. You will receive a new quest - <a href=#>Child of the Elder Blood</a>.</p><p>Philippa, on the other hand, will teleport herself to the entrance to the cave where the sunstone should be located and will wait for you there.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/child-of-the-elder-blood.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Talk to Yennefer." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>6. Meet Philippa in the elven ruins.</h3><p>Philippa will be waiting at the entrance to the <a href=#>Ancient Crypt</a> and will open it when you approach her.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/meet-philippa-in-the-elven-ruins.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Meet Philippa in the elven ruins." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>7. Explore the elven ruins with Philippa Eilhart. / Exterminate the monsters.</h3><p>Follow Philippa. After a while, you will reach the room where you will find a place of power - <a href=#>Igni</a>. There will also be a few drowners (28) and a siren (29) there so you'll have to get rid of them.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/igni-skellige-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Explore the elven ruins with Philippa Eilhart. / Exterminate the monsters." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Keep following Philippa. You'll get a little further to the ruined staircase. Philippa will fix it and you will be able to move on.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/explore-the-elven-ruins-with-philippa-eilhart-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Explore the elven ruins with Philippa Eilhart. / Exterminate the monsters." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>A little further on, there will be another enemy in your path that you will have to get rid of. This time it will be a golem (28). The next obstacle standing in your way will be a closed magic door. Fortunately, Philippa will know how to open it.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/explore-the-elven-ruins-with-philippa-eilhart-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Explore the elven ruins with Philippa Eilhart. / Exterminate the monsters." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>During your journey, Philippa will also try to get some information from you about what Yennefer is planning. You'll eventually get to the big room with three mirrors. Philippa will activate the light source hanging from the ceiling and tell you to position the mirrors properly.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/explore-the-elven-ruins-with-philippa-eilhart-3.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Explore the elven ruins with Philippa Eilhart. / Exterminate the monsters." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>8. Set up the mirror system properly.</h3><p>You must position three mirrors to direct the light beam to where Philippa stands. Start with a mirror receiving a beam of light coming out of the crystal attached to the ceiling. There's a ghost (28) near the mirror, so you have to kill him first. Then redirect the beam of light to the mirror on the right.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/set-up-the-mirror-system-properly-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Set up the mirror system properly." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Then position the second mirror so that the beam of light is reflected in the direction of the third mirror. When you adjust the last of the mirrors (there's one more ghost (28) nearby), the beam of light should illuminate the place where Philippa stands. When you've done everything right, Philippa will yell that she found the sunstone.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/set-up-the-mirror-system-properly-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Set up the mirror system properly." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p><strong>Short version</strong>: Shift all mirrors to the right.</p><h3 class=he-c>9. Examine the Sunstone.</h3><p>Come up to Philippa and after a short conversation with her, during which she will try to persuade you to convince Yennefer to "step aside", she will hand you the sunstone, turn into an owl and fly away. That's the end of this quest.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/06/640/examine-the-sunstone.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Examine the Sunstone." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Geralt overcame countless obstacles and found the Sunstone - a feat which, to give credit where it's due, would have been impossible without the help of Philippa Eilhart. Everyone knew what this meant: the preparations for the great battle against the Wild Hunt had come to an end, and what would follow their activation of the Sunstone would determine the fate of the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifpZ6xpr%2BToJimnaKoe6S7zGiuoqyTnbKzeZJmrqKklGK1trrTaKiunaOpfLW0xGaqrqajqbyvsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
