Now he says he wants to get his career back on track after being cleared of rape. <span class=credit>Justin Truong</span></figure><p>Prosecutors in San Diego announced in December that <a href=#>no rape charges would be filed</a> against Araiza, now 22, and his former Aztecs teammates.</p><p>The video evidence led them to conclude the encounters between Leonard, Ewaliko and the 17-year-old were not clearly forcible.</p><p>Ewaliko was charged with possessing child pornography after his phone was seized and denies the charge.</p><p>“I was happy that there was so much evidence and that this wasn’t a ‘he-said, she-said’ thing,” Araiza, who had always acknowledged having a consensual encounter with the girl outside but denied being part of a violent attack, told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Araiza’s punting skills were only seen by Bills fans in pre-season training and one pre-season game. He was cut before he made his regular-season NFL debut. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“A lot of cases like this are and it’s up to a jury kind of guessing. I mean, if there’s no evidence either way, it’s somewhat a guess. I’m grateful that’s not the case in this one.”</p><p>Araiza is now back at home with his parents in Poway, Calif., training hard to try to break back into the NFL — a goal he acknowledges will be tough despite his cleared name, storied collegiate career and once-promising professional start, including <a href=#>an 82-yard preseason smash</a> against the Colts.</p><p>“That’s the goal,” he told The Post. “I think people underestimate how tough it is to make it in the NFL when you’re a free agent and you’ve been out of the game for a year. That just gives teams questions, so I’m just looking for the opportunity to answer those questions.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Buffalo selected Araiza in the sixth-round of the 2022 NFL Draft. He quickly impressed coaches, kicking an 82-yard bomb during a preseason game and appeared to be line to become the team’s starter. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Araiza said he’s “very confident” he’ll be an asset if given an opportunity, whether in Buffalo or elsewhere. His agent has been in contact with a “couple” of teams, but the special teams maven understands organizations typically don’t want players to be potential “distractions,” he said.</p><p>“I just think it’s a very rare situation, especially being a punter,” Araiza said. “If I were a quarterback — no question — I’d be on a team right now. No question whatsoever, it’s just the position I play.”</p><p>The most difficult period since last summer, Araiza said, was being on the sidelines again.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">This is the 82-yard punt which wowed fans in the Bills’ pre-season game with the Colts — now Araiza wants to get back into the NFL to show his skills in full. <span class=credit>Buffalo Bills</span></figure><p>“It was a journey mentally, for sure,” Araiza said. “It had its ups and downs and there were days I was able to accept it and try to enjoy the little things in life. But then there were days when the big picture was consuming, and I could think about was what I lost.</p><p>“Watching Bills’ games — that was brutal. It was a weird thing because I couldn’t not watch them. I was too invested. Knowing so many of the players personally, the coaches, having spent the offseason with them, it was pretty heartbreaking to watch.”</p><p>Those games pushed Araiza to the brink, he admitted.</p><p>“Angry, cheated,” he said of his emotions. “I felt like I had worked my whole life for this thing and the way it was taken from me was brutal.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Matt Araiza at the Buffalo Bills practice facility in Orchard Park, just weeks before he was released by the team. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Araiza is still being sued by the alleged victim, who offered to settle for $50,000 — an offer he rejected, saying he would consider countersuing her and definitely plans to sue her attorney.</p><p>“I’m not willing to pay money to people who damaged my life irreversibly,” Araiza said. “It’s just not something I’m willing to do. But I will never waive my right to sue her attorney — ever. That lawsuit is coming.”</p><p>Araiza’s attorney, Kerry Armstrong, has <a href=#>called the civil suit a “shakedown,”</a> while the ex-NFL punter isn’t sure if he was accused due to his celebrity status on campus and likely future gridiron success.</p><p>“I don’t know what the motive was, to be honest with you,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Pa’a Ewaliko (left) and Zavier Leonard were not criminally charged in connection to the alleged attack.</figure><p>The woman, now 18, said Thursday that the recordings which convinced prosecutors to drop charges show only a portion of what happens.</p><p>“I don’t think it exonerates anybody,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today Sports</a>.</p><p>For now, Araiza said he’s content continuing to hone his craft until some team comes calling.</p><p>“I’m not really someone who enjoys the spotlight, to be honest with you,” Araiza told The Post. “I enjoy playing sports at the highest level, and with that, comes a little bit of the spotlight, but I’ll never be a ‘me-before-the-team’ guy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mamlfoq61wIyaqZqhqpZ6sbjAp6pmppaheqS7zJ6ZmpubYq6nwMSrZKCZnpx6s63PnmScoJGntKZ5w6umqaiVmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
