The Rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Fields has&nbsp;always been praised for looking identical to the Jumanji actor. But the fact got comprehensive coverage after&nbsp;Morgan County Sheriff's Office <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded a picture</a> of Fields&nbsp;on Facebook on&nbsp;August 21, 2021.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In the caption, the office clarified that a man named Tyler informed their sergeant&nbsp;that he wanted to meet the celebrity doppelganger. Fields simply fulfilled his wish and met him and his co-workers at&nbsp;Hartselle Wal-mart. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As soon as the picture made it to the internet, netizens couldn't help but notice Field's resemblance to Johnson, with their identical bald head, buffed body, bone structure and —&nbsp;let's not forget their tattoos. The look alike's&nbsp;uncanny resemblance is something to marvel at.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eric Fields and Dwayne Johnson's Tattoo Looks Similar</h2><p>Fields, shockingly, has&nbsp;the same type of circular tattoo that Johnson has on his left arm and chest. Despite their similarity, the meaning behind their tattoo, however, differs.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The tribal-inspired body art of the 49-year-old actor is his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">homage to his&nbsp;Samoan roots</a> and overcoming struggles. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The sun and intricately designed eye on his chest represent his battle against hardships. Likewise, every other design remains emblematic of chapters of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of Fields, his tattoo is more religious.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The round piece on the chest encapsulates a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hebrew writing</a> that translates to "what lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then the Hebrew line, written from his chest to trap, converts as "Jesus is the King of kings and the Lord of lords." He has fitting symbols of a Jerusalem cross tattooed at the end of the sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>Though different meanings, their tattoo looks similar, and it just added more to the gossip.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And needless to say, Fields went viral. So much so, the&nbsp;conversations about his resemblance to the actor reached Johnson's ears, prompting the Hollywood heavyweight to respond to the internet frenzy.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Dwayne Johnson’s Response to His Look-Alike</h2><p>Johnson responded to his look-alike in the best way possible —&nbsp;sharing a side-by-side photo&nbsp;of them on his Twitter on August 30, 2021. Both of them looked like the same man in the picture, with identical grins and aviator sunglasses.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But the identical look wasn't what captured everyone's attention. Instead, it was Johnson's hilarious and sweet response in the caption.&nbsp;</p><p>"Wow. Guy on the left is way cooler," the famous actor quipped while praising his&nbsp;doppelgänger. He also thanked the lieutenant for his service.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>At the end of his message, Johnson hinted they would meet one day. He stated, "we’ll drink @Teremana and I need to hear all your 'Rock stories' because I KNOW you got 'em." <a href=# rel=follow>Teremana</a> is&nbsp;Johnson's liquor brand of small-batch tequila.&nbsp;</p><p>Just before Johnson, celebrity doppelgangers for <a href=# rel=follow>Cardi B</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>John Cena</a> have made rounds on the internet.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJynlsavsYyjpqGmo6S7brDOqaeepJeWu6ix0WarmqykpLxvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
