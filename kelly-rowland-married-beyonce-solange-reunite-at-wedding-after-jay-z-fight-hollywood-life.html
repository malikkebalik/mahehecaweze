They were reportedly joined by their mother,&nbsp;<strong>Tina Knowles</strong>, and after spending a few days in the country, they&nbsp;left early in the morning on May 10.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While there are no photographs of the small, super-secret nuptials, Beyonce did post a black and white selfie on the morning of big day, saying “GoodMorning.” She seemed to be decked out in bridesmaid gear, wearing a beautiful dress and even more beautiful jewelry. Solange was nowhere to be found in the close-up snapshot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>It also appears as though the sisters attended Kelly’s wedding without Jay Z, who was not included in any of the immigration reports, E! reports. It’s unknown whether Jay had originally planned to go to the ceremony, but there does seem to be the chance that he bowed out because he didn’t want to vacation with Solange. After all, the Costa Rica trip came just three days after Solange attacked him in an elevator at the Met Gala after-party at the Standard Hotel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the shocking video of the fight, the “Losing You” singer&nbsp;really tears into Jay, and she seemingly would have torn his head off if a bodyguard hadn’t restrained her. So Jay Z was probably wise to avoid Kelly’s wedding and give Beyonce and Solange some much-needed sister time.</p><h3>Kelly Rowland Marries Tim Witherspoon</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for Kelly’s wedding with Tim Witherspoon, “it was a quick, simple ceremony,” according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>, “only around 30 people.” And hopefully, the drama that unfolded before the nuptials didn’t overshadow what sounds like a beautiful event.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kelly confirmed her engagement to Tim in December 2013 during an appearance on&nbsp;The Queen Latifah Show. “He put a ring on it,” Kelly gloated. “It’s been awhile. We’ve kept it very, very low — for years, to be completely honest.” This is Kelly’s first marriage after being engaged to NFL star&nbsp;<strong>Roy Williams&nbsp;</strong>in 2005.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Congratulations Kelly! And we hope your wedding also served as a reason for Beyonce and Solange to make peace!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>—&nbsp;Andrew Gruttadaro</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @AndrewGrutt</a></p><h3>More On Solange & Jay Z’s Fight:</h3><li>Beyonce & Jay Z Make First Public Appearance Since Solange Fight Video</li><li>Solange Knowles Yelled At Rachel Roy Before Jay Z Elevator Attack</li><li>Beyonce: Why She Didn’t Help Jay Z During Solange Knowles Attack</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH12e5BsZqSdnKHGbr7OsKOappRiuqK%2B0aKcnWWSmsawusKeZKynnJa7qLGMq5yuppmpsm7DxJ2boqaXYrOqs8etZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
