Its creator, Martina Andriano, a graphic design student from Argentina, said she drew inspiration from how the car’s speed and airflow, opting to incorporate Miami-esque splashes of lilac, blue, and vibrant pink.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Even when the car’s in motion, Andriano’s simple, intercrossed lines stand out on the RB19’s dark paint scheme, but Red Bull liked the livery for more than its clean look.</p><p>“Not all designs will work on the car,” the team’s director of brand and communications, Kelly Brittain, said. “We need to consider weight. We need to consider the placement of partner logos.”</p><p>Her team considered how each design fit Red Bull and the Miami GP. They picked 15 finalists for consideration by a judging panel, including team principal and CEO Christian Horner and representatives from Red Bull commercial partners Oracle, Bybit, and Mobil 1.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/07100710/GettyImages-1487580552-scaled.jpg alt="MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 04: Sergio Perez of Mexico and Oracle Red Bull Racing and Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing unveil their cars one off livery for the Miami Grand Prix designed by Martina Andriano during previews ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Miami at Miami International Autodrome on May 04, 2023 in Miami, Florida.

About a month ago, it gave her the good news.</p><p>“I didn’t think that I could win it,” she said. “I thought that there would be a lot of better designs than mine.”</p><p>“The design keeps the ethos of who we are but introduces Miami to the RB19 as well,” Horner said. After all, Red Bull is an energy drink company heavily involved in motorsports.</p><p>The submission window for the livery contest for the U.S. Grand Prix in October will open up in the coming weeks, with the Las Vegas one to follow.</p><p>Brittain said there was a reason behind choosing the U.S. races for this type of treatment. “The U.S. fans are brilliant. They’re so energetic, they’re so positive, they’re vocal. So actually to kind of celebrate them and the growth trajectory.”</p><p>(Top photo: Mark Thompson/Getty Images for Oracle Red Bull Racing)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k21wb2hobHxzfJFsZmltX2WEcLKQZqmenF2Xwq24jKagmqWZYrmqwsSrsGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
