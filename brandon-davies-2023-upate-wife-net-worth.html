There is no reliable information about his biological parents. However, he says that his mother was just 16 when she gave birth to him.</p><p>When Brandon was just two days old, his mother gave him over to Linda Kaithleen, who adopted him. She would give him everything he wanted, and Davies would go on to call her his mother.</p><p>Brandon spent his childhood in Provo, Utah, and attended Provo High School. Meanwhile, Brandon developed an avid interest in soccer and started playing for Utah Rangers FC as a striker. He was relatively much taller than all his teammates and played much better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brandon-youngest-with-his-mom-Linda-and-his-siblings-1024x640.jpg><p>However, after some years, he grew tired of soccer. Many of his close friends had started basketball by then and encouraged him to try out the sport as he was very tall.</p><p>Heeding their proposal, Brandon joined them and started playing basketball.</p><p>However, he struggled to strengthen his game in the initial phase but improved very little. Consequently, he got dropped from the first team.</p><p>Meanwhile, his mother, Kaithleen, motivated him and supported him to keep going after his dreams. Likewise, his siblings, Shawn and Heather, accompanied him while going for training sessions and helped him, regularly cheering him up.</p><p>Shawn and Heather were originally from India. Kathleen had adopted them like Brandon when they were very little.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Steve Canal Bio: Basketball, Net Worth, Husband & Swin Cash >>></strong></a></p><p>Meanwhile, Brandon never gave up and worked very hard to take his place in his High School team. He practiced regularly and improved very much that, in the end, he finally made it.</p><p>After high school, Davies attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.</p><h2>Brandon Davies | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Brandon Davies joined Provo High School in Utah and played soccer. Soon after, he switched to basketball and struggled very hard before making his team.</p><p>After failing to impress the coaches, he was initially dismissed from the team.

The player did not get to play many matches in his first year. However, he won the coaches’ trust and became one of the important players in his sophomore year.</p><p>Davies was having a great time as the team’s key player under the leadership of <a href=#>Jimmer Fredette</a> and was averaging 11.1 points and 6.2 rebounds per game when he got caught up in a controversy involving his girlfriend.</p><p>He was suspended from the team in 2011 for violating BYU’s honor code. In addition, the team management had made an allegation of having premarital sex with his girlfriend, Danica Mendivil.</p><p>Brigham Young finished the season with a 27-2 record and ranked No. 3 in the AP Poll that year.</p><p>However, he returned to the team as a junior and started afresh after realizing his mistakes and apologizing to his team members.</p><p>He displayed incredible gameplay in his last two seasons and was named to the All-West Coast Conference team in both new seasons.</p><p>In his final season, he became team captain and achieved good numbers averaging 17.7 points and 8.0 rebounds per game.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Brandon decided to go for the 2013 NBA draft after his graduation. Meanwhile, he decided to join Portsmouth Invitational Tournament pre-draft camp.

Following this, Brandon signed a contract with the Los Angeles Clippers in September that year, but the club released him the next month.</p><p>Soon after, he signed with the Philadelphia 76ers on October 28, 2013. He made his NBA debut in a match against the Chicago Bulls in which he posted two critical points.</p><p>However, Brandon had a finger injury just two months into the league, which forced him to go on a long rest.</p><p>Brandon then briefly played again for the 76ers in 2014, after which he was traded to the Brooklyn Nets for the remaining 2014 season. He played 7 games all together from the club before being released in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brandon-Davies-in-the-Nets-Jersey-1024x1024.gif><p>Brandon had to abandon the NBA as no club showed interest in him. However, many foreign clubs pursued him following his release, and he eventually joined the French club, Elan Chalon.</p><p>Likewise, he played in various other leagues in different countries, winning leagues such as French League and Lithuanian LKL League before proceeding to Barcelona to play in the Liga ACB.</p><p>Davis signed a two-year contract with FC Barcelona on July 4, 2019.
