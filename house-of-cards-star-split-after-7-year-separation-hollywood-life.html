The couple married in 2002, and Benedict ended his marriage to the House of Cards actress just recently, even though the two have actually been separated since 2009. Benedict cited irreconcilable differences for the reason behind the split. As for the reason behind why he decided to file for divorce just now after being apart for seven years? He reportedly has not given a reason.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform 0BweU7cE]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Fortunately, the divorce for the ex-couple seems to be very amicable.&nbsp;Benedict filed for joint custody of his and Molly’s 10-year-old son, and doesn’t want either to pay the other’s spousal support. As far as assets to split, he told TMZ that there are none. We are so happy to hear that the ex-couple seem to be on very good terms and that Benedict is making sure that everything is fair in the divorce.</p><h3><a href=#>Click Here To See More ‘House of Cards’ Pics</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the meantime, we’re just so excited for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season five of the hit Netflix show</a> to premiere in 2017, and we’re counting down the days.

If you recall, Claire also broke the fourth wall when she looked directly into the camera along with Frank. Seriously, it was such an intense moment, and the possibilities for what will happen in season five are just endless.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of Benedict and Molly filing for divorce now, after being separated for so long?
