Also know some more</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Nick DiGiovanni</strong> crushed all the other contestants in the season 10 of <i>Masterchef</i> to reach the finale. The 22-year-old grad student from Harvard University could've become the youngest Masterchef winner.</p><p>In the finale, he lined up with <strong>Dorian Hunter</strong> and <strong>Sarah Faherty</strong> to grab the title of the Masterchef. Did Nick go on to win it? Keep reading as we answer that question with other facts of DiGiovanni's life.</p><h2>Winning the White Apron...</h2><p>Coming from Italian and Persian heritages, Nick has a great taste when it comes to cuisines. He loves making new items but hates following any set recipes. As a creative chef, he likes to mix things up and create something extraordinary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/26/Nick%20White-1569487228714.jpg><p>On May 29, 2019, the Harvard Grad student cooked a lamb ravioli with whipped lemon creme fraiche and mint oil. This delicious-looking food earned him a spot in the <i>Masterchef season 10</i>. He came out wearing the white apron and was ready to take the show by storm.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Youngest Contestant in the Show</h2><p>In the top 20 list of the show, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nick was the only competitor who was very young.</a> As a Harvard Grad, he followed his teachings of never giving up and grabbing every challenge with both hands. In an interview with Delish, he said,</p><p>"I actually liked being one of the younger ones and I came into it with an attitude that I was a sponge and just tried to soak in as much as I could".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/26/Nick%20cooking-1569487318666.jpg><p>This attitude of learning helped him to go a long way in the competition. Maybe this also helped him to be more confident and calm to prepare better food. He reached the final of the show and if he'd won it then, Nick would become the youngest winner of the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Dorina, however, became the winner of season 10 beating Nick and Sarah in the final. &nbsp;</p><h2>He created his own Food Course at Harvard University</h2><p>While choosing for the concentrations at the University, DiGiovanni could not find the one he wanted to do the most. Later on, when he joined the class of Professor <strong>David Weitz</strong> he found the way to focus on his interest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/26/Nick%20Harvard-1569487545061.jpg><p>Nick created a concentration in food studies which was challenged by diverse stakeholders. Despite getting rejected at first he continued to pursue what he believed in. Along with learning to prepare delicious food, he specialized in climate science, chemistry, and food business.</p><p>Just like Nick, Chef <a href=#>Nicole Centeno</a>, <a href=#>Jacinda Carter</a>, and <a href=#>Morgan Harvey</a> are also in the business of healthy and plant-based food. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>The Leadership Quality to Run a Restaurant</h2><p>In episode eight of season 10 of Masterchef, he <a rel=nofollow href=#>showed his leadership skill by preparing the replicas of the dishes served at Joe Bastianich restaurant.</a> DiGiovanni led the team and because of his calm and cool approach, his team nailed the challenge.</p><p>Nick's team faced off with <strong>Michael Silverstein</strong> in preparing the dishes. Both the leaders learned cooking the dishes from Chef <strong>Liz Hong</strong> and passed the information to their team. From this challenge, Nick proved his leadership skills in order to run his own restaurant.&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p>For further updates, keep reading <a rel=nofollow href=#>MarriedCeleb.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp%2BYnKxdlq%2BwwdNmpaKbm2KxqrPIqK2app6eeq6t0q2cq5uYmrNuv8SaqqimXWZ9brLIp5iloaOp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
