She even deleted the majority of posts relating to her husband.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As of now, her socials have been turned into her personal art and photography exhibit.</p><h2>Mulaney Moved On</h2><p>Not even a week since the <a href=# rel=follow>announcement</a> of their divorce, the stand-up comedian made headlines yet again—this time for finding himself a <a href=# rel=follow>new woman</a>, Olivia Munn.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On May 13, 2021, People came forth with a source that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">claimed</a> Mulaney was dating Munn whilst assuring the outlet that the relationship was fairly new and they were taking things slow.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The celebrity couple had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a> one another at Seth Meyers’s wedding in 2013 and remained good friends.
