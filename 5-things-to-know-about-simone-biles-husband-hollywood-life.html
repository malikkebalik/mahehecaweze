He started his career with the Arizona Cardinals in 2018</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Unfortunately, he was injured before the season even began. It was his last week of offseason activities when Jonathan tore his ACL during a drill. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just laying on the ground crying because I don‚Äôt even know how that works. I‚Äôm thinking, I came all the way here and got hurt,‚Äù he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>News Press Now</a> in July 2019.&nbsp;But the Cardinals didn‚Äôt give up on him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>‚ÄúI‚Äôm laying in the training room, towel on my head, and this guy from the front office comes down, taps me on the shoulder and says, ‚ÄòWe were noticing what you were doing out there.‚Äô He told me, ‚ÄòI can guarantee you two things: We‚Äôre gonna take care of you for this season and you‚Äôre gonna come back stronger from this. It‚Äôs just gonna depend on the work you put in,'‚Äù Jonathan told the site. ‚ÄúI took that to heart.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jonathan-owens-5-things-to-know-ap-images-embed.jpg><h2>2. He joined the Houston Texans roster in December 2021</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jonathan was scooped up by the Houston Texans in September 2019, one month after being waived by the Cardinals. Originally signed as a member of their practice squad, Jonathan signed a reserve/future contract in January 2020. He was a member of the practice squad, after briefly being waived in August 2021, but he was brought on to the main roster in December, and he got his first interception the day after Christmas. As of May 2023, Jonathan is a free agent, after he was placed on injured reserve after dislocating his wrist during a game.</p><h2>3. He played football for Missouri Western State University</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jonathan was a star on the Griffons. He was a second-team all-conference and all-academic player, who only missed one game during his entire college career. Jonathan&nbsp;had 95 tackles and two interceptions in his final season, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Houston Chronicle</a>.</p><h2>4. He and Simone started dating in summer 2020</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Simone and boyfriend <strong>Stacey Ervin Jr.</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split after three years</a> together in March 2020, she revealed in the August 2020 issue of Vogue.

She accompanied the sweet message with a photo of Jonathan giving her a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>piggyback ride</a>.</p><h2>5. They went Instagram official with their relationship in August 2020</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Their relationship was confirmed when Simone posted two sweet photos to Instagram on August 2.
