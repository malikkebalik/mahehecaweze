Kang is talking about giving Scott more time with Cassie. Janet warns Scott not to trust Kang because he can “rewrite existence and shatter timelines.” Scott doesn’t listen, and his decision comes back to haunt him.

We both just have to lose.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first official trailer</a> dropped on October 24, 2022, and gave fans a first glimpse of <strong>Kathryn Newton</strong> as Scott’s daughter, Cassie Lang.

The film was initially set to come out in 2022 but was delayed along with many Marvel projects due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It got pushed back to Feb. 17, 2023, and then to July 28, 2023. However, in April 2022, Marvel/Disney returned the film to its February 2023 release date. It comes out after <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Panther 2</a>&nbsp;(November 11, 2022) and before&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a>&nbsp;(May 5, 2023) and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Marvels</a>&nbsp;(July 28, 2023).</p><h2>Who’s In The Cast For Ant-Man & The Wasp 3</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Peyton Reed is back to direct the third Ant-Man film, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.

Paul made his MCU debut in&nbsp;Ant-Man&nbsp;and returned for the sequel. He’s also appeared in&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;and&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame. Scott is a thief-turned-superhero who can change his size thanks to Hank Pym’s technology.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Evangeline Lilly</a>&nbsp;</strong>as Hope van Dyne/Wasp. Evangeline has starred in the same Marvel movies as Paul, with the exception of&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War. Hope inherits her superhero identity from her mother. She can shrink her size and fly with insect wings. Hope and Scott are a romantic couple.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Douglas</a>&nbsp;</strong>as Hank Pym. Michael starred in the first two&nbsp;Ant-Man&nbsp;movies and&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame. Hank is Hope’s father, Janet’s husband, and a former SHIELD agent who became the original Ant-Man. He recruits Scott to take over the Ant-Man identity and gives him the suit.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Michelle Pfeiffer</a>&nbsp;</strong>as Janet van Dyne. Michelle made a cameo in Ant-Man&nbsp;and had a bigger role in&nbsp;Ant-Man and the Wasp. Janet is Hope’s mother and Hank’s wife. She was the original Wasp and was lost in the Quantum Realm for 30 years until she was rescued in the second film. She’s passed down her Wasp suit and identity to Hope.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Kathryn Newton</a>&nbsp;</strong>as Cassie Lang. Kathryn (<a href=# rel=noopener>Big Little Lies</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Society</a>) makes her MCU debut as Scott’s daughter. The role was previously played by&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Emma Fuhrmann</a>&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame. Fans believe that Cassie will be in the Young Avengers with Wanda’s children and Kate Bishop, which is the case in the Marvel Comics.</li><li><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Majors</a> </strong>as Kang the Conqueror. Jonathan (Lovecraft Country) played Kang in the Disney+ series&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Loki</a>. Kang is an alternate-timeline variant of the character He Who Remains. He is rumored to be the next big villain in the MCU.</li><li><strong>Randall Parks</strong> as FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Randall played the role of Jimmy in&nbsp;Ant-Man and the Wasp&nbsp;and the miniseries&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>WandaVision</a>. His return was confirmed at D230 Expo.</li></ul><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bill Murray</a>&nbsp;</strong>appears in&nbsp;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&nbsp;as a villain, though details of his role remain undisclosed.&nbsp;<strong>Michael Pena</strong>, who played Luis, Scott Lang’s best friend and former criminal liaison in the first two films, is not expected to return for Quantumania. The same goes for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Judy Greer</strong></a>, who played Scott’s ex-wife, Maggie, and rapper&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>T.I.</strong></a>, who played Dave, a member of Scott’s X-Con Security crew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ant-man-the-wasp-3-embed3.jpg><h2>Who Is The Creative Team?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Peyton Reed&nbsp;</strong>is directing&nbsp;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, just like he did with the first two films. The creative team also includes Marvel Studios President <strong>Kevin Feige</strong> (producer),&nbsp;<strong>Jeff Loveness&nbsp;</strong>(screenwriter), and&nbsp;<strong>Christopher Beck&nbsp;</strong>(music composer). Filming took place in Turkey, England, and San Francisco starting in February 2021 and wrapped that November.</p><h2>What’s The Plot Of Ant-Man & The Wasp 3?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The official plot for&nbsp;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&nbsp;has yet be released by Marvel. The film may explore time traveling since Kang has a big role. In an Oct. 2021 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>,&nbsp;Evangeline Lilly said she understands her character Hope more after reading the script for&nbsp;Quantumania.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ant-man-the-wasp-3-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>“Hope is an odd enigma for me. But the truth is that I find it harder to know and understand Hope than any other character I’ve ever played before,” Evangeline said. “And I will say that after I read the script of [Quantumania], I did have a kind of eureka moment; I said to Peyton [Reed], ‘Oh my God, I think I finally get her.’ So I’m hoping that when we come to wrap and when I see the movie, I’m going to know the difference.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The first trailer for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&nbsp;was shown at the D23 Expo. It features Scott having lunch with Jimmy Woo, before the entire Lang family is sucked into the Quantum realm, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PopVerse</a>. Scott comes face to face with Kang the Conqueror, who claims that he’s killed the superhero before.</p><h2>Is Anything Known About Future Ant-Man Movies?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Marvel/Disney have yet to confirm if there’s more&nbsp;<i>Ant-Man&nbsp;</i>movies coming out after&nbsp;Quantumania. A <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fourth&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;movie</a> recently came out, so there’s precedent for a Marvel hero getting more than three movies. Paul Rudd seems to be loving the role, so he’d probably be onboard. The actor is <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>basically aging backwards</a>, after all, so there’s no reason he can’t keep playing Ant-Man for a long time!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Cnq2alkaN6orrDZquhnV2srrS8jGxknJmjqXp1g5hvaWpqXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
