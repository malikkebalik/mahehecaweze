He later funded her attendance at a software coding school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698730197_857_Jeffrey-Epstein-threatened-to-expose-Bill-Gates-alleged-affair-with.jpg><p>In the 2017 email, Epstein demanded that Gates reimburse him for the investment in Antonova’s coding education, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>This email followed Gates’ refusal to participate in Epstein’s multi-billion-dollar charity, which he was attempting to establish with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Gates, aged 67, has previously acknowledged meeting Epstein on several occasions in the 2010s, expressing remorse. These meetings were aimed at raising funds for the Gates Foundation.</p><p>A spokesperson for Gates stated, “Mr. Gates met with Epstein solely for philanthropic purposes. Having failed repeatedly to draw Mr. Gates beyond these matters, Epstein tried unsuccessfully to leverage a past relationship to threaten Mr. Gates.”</p><p>The spokesperson also clarified that Gates never succumbed to the threat, emphasizing that there were no financial dealings between Gates and Epstein.</p><p>While Antonova expressed her ignorance of Epstein’s true identity at the time they met, she later condemned his actions. However, she declined to comment on her alleged relationship with Gates.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiYpaSVnLKledOhqZ6ZpGKvunnJnp2fqpWueqa80q2coqZdqbxuvsSvnJqkXZe2rbiMoJitnaNirqeywKKpZq%2BZqbVuvtSsqqKZnmKvs7XDoJxmqJyWxqa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
