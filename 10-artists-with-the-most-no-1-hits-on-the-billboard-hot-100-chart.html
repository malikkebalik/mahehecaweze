They had five No. 1 singles in a row: “Where Did Our Love Go,” “Baby Love,” and “Come See About Me” in 1964, then “Stop! In the Name of Love” and “Back in My Arms Again” in 1965.</p><p>Afterward, there was “I Hear a Symphony,” also in 1965, “You Can’t Hurry Love” and “You Keep Me Hangin’ On” in 1966, “Love Is Here and Now You’re Gone” and “The Happening” in 1967, “Love Child” in 1968, and “Someday We’ll Be Together” in 1969.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Madonna-1.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=5Michael_Jackson_topped_the_charts_13_times></span>5)Michael Jackson, topped the charts 13 times<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael has 13 number-one hits on the Hot 100 as a solo artist.

He had five No. 1 songs in 1956 alone: “Heartbreak Hotel,” “I Want You, I Need You, I Love You,” “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Hound Dog,” and “Love Me Tender.” Later, there was “Too Much,” “All Shook Up,” “(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear,” and “Jailhouse Rock.” In 1958, he had “Don’t” and “Hard Headed Woman.” In 1959, there was just “A Big Hunk o’ Love.” “Stuck on You,” “Now or Never,” and “Are You Lonesome Tonight” in 1960, “Surrender” in 1961, “Good Luck Charm” in 1962, and “Suspicious Minds” in 1969.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Rihanna-1-4.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2Mariah_Carey%E2%80%99s_19_chart-topping_songs></span>2)Mariah Carey’s 19 chart-topping songs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Her</a> talents and stage presence were clear from the beginning, and her first number-one single was also her debut song, ‘Vision Of Love’, in 1990 at 20 years old.
