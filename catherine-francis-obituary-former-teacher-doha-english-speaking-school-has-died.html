A dedicated member of our teaching staff since 2004, Ms. Francis was an integral part of the DESS fabric, leaving an indelible mark on the institution. Her life was devoted to the noble pursuit of education, and her unwavering commitment to her students resonated deeply within our community.</p><p>Ms. Francis will be remembered not only for her professional dedication but also for her unparalleled passion and infectious enthusiasm. Her tireless efforts and relentless energy served as a wellspring of inspiration for both her colleagues and her students alike. She was a beacon of guidance, shaping the lives and futures of those fortunate enough to have been under her tutelage. Her legacy will continue to echo in the hallways of DESS, a testament to her enduring impact on the lives she touched.</p><p>In this time of mourning, our thoughts are with Catherine’s three children, as well as the entire DESS staff, parents, and students who are grappling with the weight of this loss. As a tightly-knit community, it is crucial that we rally together to support one another through this difficult period. Let us keep alive the memory of this exceptional individual whose spirit will forever linger in the ethos of DESS. We are profoundly grateful to have shared our journey with such an extraordinary soul, and her legacy will forever be cherished within the DESS family.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwr8Ctn56qmaOybrLRmqWcoaNivKO1066Yq7Fdm7yzucSrZK2dkZi1pr6MnaahmV2au6i4yKyfZqugmq6stc2gZKybmKS8rXnHmqpmnJmasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
