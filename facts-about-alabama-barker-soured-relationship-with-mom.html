She was born on December 24, 2005, and named after her father’s favorite character,&nbsp;Alabama Whitman, from the movie&nbsp;True Romance. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Like most people her age, Barker spends a lot of time on social media and is a certified TikTok star with a staggering 1.1 million followers. In fact, the social media influencer recently&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted</a>&nbsp;a TikTok video lip-syncing to Kehlani’s ‘The Letter.’&nbsp;</p><h2>Calling Out Her Mother</h2><p>Barker was lip-synching to the song with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lyrics </a>of feeling abandoned by a mother: “And every girl needs a mother/ And damn it, I needed you/ Instead you dug for cover/ And you ran from the truth.” Barker’s followers didn’t take long to speculate that she was throwing a subliminal shade at Moakler.&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A few days later, Barker made headlines again when she made another claim on social media. This time she shared a video of herself lip-syncing to ‘Barking’ by Ramz. Over the video, she wrote, “I cut off family too. They do you the dirtiest.”</p><p>The 15-year-old’s TikTok declaration about cutting ties with her mother came after a public feud with her. Her older brother Landon&nbsp;too, had been accusing their mother of being an <a href=# rel=follow>absentee parent.</a> She also took to the Instagram story to share the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>My mom has never wholly been in my life. Can you guys stop&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">painting</a>&nbsp;her out to be an amazing mom? Did your moms ask to see you on Mother’s Day [because] mine didn’t? I’m done keeping it a secret, reality show.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Travis did not comment on his children’s internet activities. But Moakler’s boyfriend, Matthew Rondeau, defended her in an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;with Life & Style magazine, saying that one reason he loved her was that she loved and cared for her family so much.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Appreciating Her Father&nbsp;</h2><p>Barker might not be getting along with her mother, but it appears she has a great relationship with her father. In a November 2020 birthday <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shout-out</a> on Instagram for her father, Barker could not stop gushing.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She uploaded a photo of her and her father when she was a toddler and&nbsp;wrote that she loved him so much and iterated that it was inspiring to watch him do what he loves. She added he was the biggest blessing and that their bond would never be broken.</p><p>The 15-year-old makeup lover was also seen spending time with her father, in a video of her giving him&nbsp;a makeover. The 45-year-old drummer sat still while Barker tested a new viral foundation to cover his&nbsp;face tattoos.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At one point, the adorable duo couldn’t stop laughing after Barker accidentally called one of her dad’s tattoos a “handkerchief” when it was actually an anchor. Barker then wraps up the video with some jaw-dropping before and after photos in which Travis’s tattoos are nonexistent.</p><p>Barker and her father do seem to share a special bond.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnkaGuo63MmmSbmaKgsrN5wKCcZqWfonupwMyl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
