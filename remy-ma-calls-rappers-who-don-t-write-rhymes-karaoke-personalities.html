Having that status grants Remy the right to comment on the status of rap and she never holds her tongue.</p><p>During a recent visit to the See The Thing Is… podcast, the Bronx native weighed in on the topic of rappers who don’t write their own rhymes. Remy feels those who don’t rely on their own pen are practically karaoke singers since they’re reciting other people’s words.</p><p>“Contrary to popular belief, again, you have to write it. You, you are the person that has to write it,” Remy said before labeling those who don’t write as characters. “They’re a great karaoke personality; they’re great at karaoke.

During her appearance on Drink Champs, the Terror Squad MC even corrected co-host N.O.R.E. when he referred to Doja as a rapper.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I don’t think she’s a rapper,” Remy said. “Let’s be clear with that. They put her in the rapper category, I don’t think she’s a rapper. But she makes dope records, and I think she’s dope.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2021/12/211226-doja-cat-getty.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Remy Ma Sparks Twitter War After She Says Doja Cat Isn't A Rapper</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 27, 2022</p></a><p>Remy Ma continues to help keep lyricism alive in Hip Hop In February, the 42-year-old launched the <a class=underline-link href=#>first-ever all-female battle rap league titled Chrome 23</a>.
