Prince and Paris showed up in official capacity, walking the red carpet along with other celebrities before the show. Bigi was also there, but kept a lower profile. He was photographed outside the theater with his siblings after the play, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/paris-jackson-prince-blanket-rare-public-appearance-broadway-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Bigi looked all grown up for the night out, showing off his long curly locks and wearing a black suit and white button down. Paris was stunning in her red dress, which was held together with a wrap tie around the middle. She paired the look with velvet red booties and her hair parted to the side in loose curls. Prince also looked dapper for the occasion, wearing a black suit and tie, with his long locks pulled back into a low ponytail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/paris-jackson-prince-blanket-rare-public-appearance-broadway-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Paris and Prince have both followed in their father’s footsteps with lives in the public eye, Bigi has kept much more to himself over the years. However, in Oct. 2021, he did <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>appear alongside Prince</a> for an interview about climate change on Good Morning Britain. Bigi opened up about his passion for making young people aware of climate change during the interview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Michael shared Prince and Paris with&nbsp;<strong>Debbie Rowe</strong>, while Bigi was born to an unknown surrogate. Bigi was just seven years old when his father died in June 2009. Before the Oct. 2021 interview, Bigi hadn’t been seen in public for about a year, with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>previous sightings</a> taking place in August and September 2020. He appears to have maintained a close relationship with his older siblings, though, as they all came together for their father at the Broadway show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49rZpukkaO4psCMo5ico6Oku26u0aiYna%2BRrnq0tM6wZKmZop7AbrzRoqWcnV2ltbDAzqxka2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
