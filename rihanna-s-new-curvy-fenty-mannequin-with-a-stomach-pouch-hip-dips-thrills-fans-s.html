However, now that RiRi has her very own fashion label, <strong>Fenty</strong>, the star has made sure to include women of all sizes in her new company. Rihanna debuted her very first Fenty collection at a pop-up store in New York City on June 18, and while fans were excited to see her new collection, they were even more thrilled when they noticed a curvy mannequin. The curvy mannequin was dressed in a sleeveless neon orange skintight bodycon midi dress, and through the dress you can clearly see that the mannequin has full breasts, a stomach, and wide hips, which delighted many people. While stores usually display their clothes on a size two mannequin with no curves, Rihanna wanted to make sure people realized that anyone can wear her new clothes and that it is completely all-inclusive of size.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Fans took to Twitter to praise the singer, with one user, @Chaantellie, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writing</a>, ‚ÄúHere for this mannequin having hip dips and a little pooch.‚Äù Another user, @candeliferia, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared</a>, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful and a relief to see. Realistic models and mannequins can only benefit the stores/designers. People can see what they will literally look like in the clothes selling more clothing and lowering returns.‚Äù Meanwhile, user @Karemadaniele, wrote, ‚ÄúI was today years old when I seen my first mannequin with hip dips like me! Thank you Fenty.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The tweets did not stop rolling in, as fans couldn‚Äôt control their excitement over finally seeing a mannequin that resembles their body type. ‚ÄúThe mannequin has a little tum and hips. Ok ok!! Rihanna gets it,‚Äù user @ClassyHippyLife wrote, while user @Sydothekiddo_, tweeted, ‚ÄúI have hip dips and saw it as an imperfection and now a fenty mannequin has them and they look bomb.‚Äù</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>FENTY.
