Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan), who is sponsoring the bill in his chamber, said the measure’s prospects were “looking good” though “nothing is done until it’s over the finish line.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Sammy Cohen Eckstein died in a 2013 traffic crash, an event that inspired his mother to become a street safety activist. <span class=credit>Courtesy of Amy Cohen</span></figure><p>Traffic fatalities declined over the past decade as the city pursued a “Vision Zero” approach — only to see <a href=#>rates rise again in recent years.</a></p><p>But that trend could change if the city adopts lower speed limits.</p><p>“Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan — or the reverse,” Hoylman-Sigal said while referencing the sway legislators from outside the city have over street-level matters within the five boroughs.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Research shows fatality rates spike once vehicles go faster than 20 miles per hour. <span class=credit>Christopher Sadowski</span></figure><p>Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal (D-Manhattan), who is sponsoring the bill in her chamber, told The Post she is “hopeful” about the bill’s chances in her chamber considering how it has picked up support from colleagues in recent months.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was at one of the first news conferences 10 years ago after Sammy was killed to speak about the need to make make the streets safer for pedestrians,” she said. “People are pretty familiar with [the proposal] so I feel good about it.”</p><p>Research has shown traffic crash fatality rates spike after vehicles exceed 20 miles per hour, with a 70% higher likelihood of death for someone struck at 30 miles per hour compared to 25 miles per hour, <a href=#>according to ProPublica.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mom, told The Post passage of the bill was “overdue” after three years of fighting. <span class=credit>Warzer Jaff</span></figure><p>The pending bill would allow New York City to set a 20-mile-per-hour speed limit though higher speeds would still be allowed.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">State Sen.
