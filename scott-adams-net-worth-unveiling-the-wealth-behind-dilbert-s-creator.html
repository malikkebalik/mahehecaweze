Inspired by Peanuts comics, he began drawing at six and won his first drawing competition at 11.

Berkeley in 1986.</p><p><img data-expand=600 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/kahawatungu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2-107.png alt="Scott Adams Net Worth" width=1330 height=879 data-sizes="(max-width: 1330px) 100vw, 1330px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dilbert_Emerges></span><strong>Dilbert Emerges</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Scott Adams’ foray into the corporate world, working at Pacific Bell, provided the fodder for Dilbert.
