The now-7-year-old weighed 5 pounds and 11 ounces and measured 18.5 inches in height. However, her parents kept her conception and arrival a secret until after she was born.</p><p class=dh>The day after Frances Cole entered the world, her dad shared a sweet tweet on her behalf, saying she "sends her thanks." The father of two also revealed his nickname for his secondborn, as he affectionately referred to her as "Franny."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Frances Cole Fallon's Parents Did Not Give Up until She Was Born via Surrogate</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Three days after <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jimmy-fallon-welcomes-daughter-frances-cole/>Frances Cole</a> was born, her dad displayed her newborn pictures upon his return on his show.

They opened up about those issues during an "At Home Edition" episode of Jimmy's "The Tonight Show" in April 2020.</p><p class=dh>As they strolled their neighborhood streets, Jimmy and Nancy revealed that having children had always been a shared goal for them as a couple.
