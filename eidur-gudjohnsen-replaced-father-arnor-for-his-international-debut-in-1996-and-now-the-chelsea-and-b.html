Unfortunately, Eidur suffered a serious injury soon after and, by the time he was fit again, Arnor had retired.</p><p>Describing the feeling of playing in the same team as his son, Arnor said in a 2018 interview: "It was of course emotional.</p><p>"It was a crazy thing to look across the changing room and see your own son there. I tried to be a good role model growing up and the best father I could be, and seeing Eidur in the same changing room as me gave me great pride as it showed that I had also done a good job in raising him."</p><p>Eidur said having the old man there definitely helped.</p><p>"I remember being very nervous. Not just at the possibility of playing with my dad but the whole idea of representing my country at such a young age. Having my dad in the changing room really helped - he was such a good role model and made me feel at ease. He made everything feel normal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686597156.jpg><p>Arnor enjoyed success as a player, winning three Belgian league titles, top scoring for Anderlecht in the 1986/87 season and finishing as runner-up in both the UEFA and Cup Winners Cups in 1984 and 1990 respectively.</p><p>Eidur, though, went on to have legendary career in the game, winning two Premier League titles with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chelsea</a>, two LaLiga crowns and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Champions League</a> title at Barcelona as well as appearing 88 times for his country.</p><p>And Gudjohnsen Sr saw all the hallmarks of a great player at a young age and could see that he would follow in his footsteps from the age of 15.</p><p>"I remember thinking, 'Wow, he’s the best player on the pitch', he recalled of one of Eidur's training sessions.</p><p>"He had such great balance and was technically very good with both feet. I knew the next year or two would be crucial for his development but if he kept progressing he had a chance to play for the country."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686597039.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686597166.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686597043.jpg><p>Now, his three sons are hoping to emulate their decorated grandfather and father, who is the assistant coach of the national team.</p><p>Two of them are on their way to doing that already.</p><p>In what is another brilliant story involving the family, history was made on Wednesday night when Iceland hosted Liechtenstein in a World Cup qualifier at Reykjavik’s Laugardalsvöllur.</p><p>Eldest Sveinn and middle child Andri combined for a goal after coming on as substitutes in the 4-0 victory.</p><p>The former headed down a chipped ball into the box to his brother, who produced a tidy finish with their dad watching on proudly.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/GettyImages-1183466823-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/GettyImages-51851706.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686597152.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686597162.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686597151.jpg><p>Sveinn, 23, plays for Swedish side Elfsborg, while the two younger sons Andri, 19 and Daniel, 15 are both on the books of Real Madrid.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>If they get anything close to achieving what their father and grandfather did, they’ll also have legendary status in Iceland.</p><p>Let’s hope their future kids get the memo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifKe7zq2ZmqScZIZ3fZhva2idmZnCs3nGrpujp5ijwKa6jJ2YnWWTnbKtv8SaZKyskanAbr%2FOp6pmoZOauaK6w2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
