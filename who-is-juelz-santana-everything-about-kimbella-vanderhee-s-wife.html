It's because their patience level had dried out thinking about whether the pair would marry.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Kimbella's Husband Served Jail Time?</h2><p>The rocky relationship and rough times for Kimbella and Juelz did not exist until their marriage. The rock-bottom moment in their relationship was probably when Kimbella's husband was sentenced to jail.</p><p>It didn't happen long after their marriage. Juelz was arrested at the airport when it was found that he was carrying a 38 caliber handgun and oxycodone pills with him.
