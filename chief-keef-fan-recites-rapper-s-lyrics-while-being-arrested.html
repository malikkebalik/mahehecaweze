In the clip, a man who appears to go by the name Lil B (not the famous Bay Area rapper) started rapping Keef’s 2014 track “Earned It” as two officers are putting him in handcuffs – letting them know he had bail money on deck.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I’ma bond right out I ain’t broke (I ain’t broke)/ N-ggas ain’t getting no money it ain’t a joke!” Lil B raps in the clip.</p><p>The officers found it as amusing as the bystanders did and laughed along with everyone, even as B got in their faces to let them know he was actually out on bond from a different situation.&nbsp;“And I’m out on bond! Fuck you talmbout?” he said. “And I’m out on bond and I just out yesterday!”</p><p>Lil B isn’t the only Chief Keef fan who can spit his lyrics on a dime. <a href=# rel=noopener>GloRilla</a> has been loud and proud about her love for Sosa for some time now and <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>not too long ago rapped one of his songs while talking to HipHopDX on a red carpet</a>.</p><p>“She say she love me, whatever that is/ Do me a favor, save that shit,” she rapped with a smile on her face at the 2022 American Music Awards.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/chief-keefs-bathroom-studio-means-he-never-misses-a-beat-250x142.png alt="Chief Keef’s Bathroom Studio Means He Never Misses A Beat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Chief Keef’s Bathroom Studio Means He Never Misses A Beat</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 19, 2023</p></a><p>The “Tomorrow 2” rhymer has long been a fan of Chief Keef even before her rise to fame. She explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Posted On the Corner</a>last year that Keef’s music actually made her want to become a rapper.</p><p>“I never have one song when I say this, but Chief Keef — all of his music just made me want to rap,” she said. “You can hear it in the songs that I make; I be liking to make people [move]… and Chief Keef do that to me!”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>She added: “He make me just wanna get turnt up.
