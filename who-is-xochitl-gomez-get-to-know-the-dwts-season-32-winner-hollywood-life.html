America has the ability to jump between the Multiverse, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wanda/Scarlet Witch</a> attempts to take America’s powers in the film. America is a queer Latina who was raised by two mothers. America is the MCU’s first Latina LGBTQ+ character.</p><h2>Xochitl Rose to Fame on The Baby-Sitters Club</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Xochitl <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>played Dawn Schafer</a> in the first season of Netflix’s The Baby-Sitters Club. She had to leave the show ahead of its second season after getting her role in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. “It was sad that I could only do one season of&nbsp;The Baby-Sitters Club&nbsp;since I obviously wanted to do the second season, but both the show and&nbsp;Doctor Strange were filming at the same time. It was during [peak] COVID, so I couldn’t fly from England to Canada. I was really bummed out,” Xochitl told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seventeen</a>. Prior to Doctor Strange, Xochitl appeared in TV shows like Raven’s Home, You’re the Worst, and Gentified.</p><h2>Xochitl Is Experienced in Martial Arts</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Xochitl is a fan of martial arts, which she started before The Baby-Sitters Club. While auditioning for Doctor Strange, the actress revealed to Seventeen that she did “kickboxing and stunt tumbling every other day for a couple of hours. It was intense, but I felt like it was necessary because if I got to the next stage, I didn’t wanna do a little and be nervous.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/xochitl-gomez-update-embed-2.jpg><h2>Xochitl Has Dyslexia</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The actress revealed she is dyslexic in an interview about how she prepared for her role in Doctor Strange 2. “It’s kind of the same preparation I do for all my auditions. I get the slides and go over them and over them because I have dyslexia, so in order for me to not fumble around, I have to really actually know the material,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People Chica</a>.</p><h2>Xochitl Is Bilingual</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Xochitl’s dad is from Mexico, and she told People Chica that she “grew up with a lot of Mexican influences because all the kids I played with and my babysitter was from Mexico. My parents speak Spanish at home, so I feel like I’ve lived in both worlds, and that has shaped who I am as a person.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LFsK%2FHoqulZZekuqbGjG1ua29na31w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
